Crop_lines\0_handwritten_023_a02-008\line_0.jpg	Seven Commonwealth countries have told Mr. Sandys,
Crop_lines\0_handwritten_023_a02-008\line_1.jpg	Commonwealth Relations Secretary, that they wish to be kept
Crop_lines\0_handwritten_023_a02-008\line_2.jpg	in touch in London. Three of them - Canada, Australia,
Crop_lines\0_handwritten_023_a02-008\line_3.jpg	New Zealand - will have strong delegations at an opening
Crop_lines\0_handwritten_023_a02-008\line_4.jpg	meeting in London on Monday. Once the Common
Crop_lines\0_handwritten_023_a02-008\line_5.jpg	Market’s Council of Ministers draws up the procedure
Crop_lines\0_handwritten_023_a02-008\line_6.jpg	for negotiations in a fortnight’s time, these Commonwealth
Crop_lines\0_handwritten_023_a02-008\line_7.jpg	countries can arrange for observers to advise the British
Crop_lines\0_handwritten_023_a02-008\line_8.jpg	negotiating team.
Crop_lines\1_handwritten_026_a02-037\line_0.jpg	powerful addresses
Crop_lines\1_handwritten_026_a02-037\line_1.jpg	by Comrades Krobo Edusei, Tawia Adamafio,” and
Crop_lines\1_handwritten_026_a02-037\line_2.jpg	others. Strong deeds followed strong words. In Takoradi
Crop_lines\1_handwritten_026_a02-037\line_3.jpg	a "limited state of emergency” was declared, giving
Crop_lines\1_handwritten_026_a02-037\line_4.jpg	the Government adequate power to maintain all
Crop_lines\1_handwritten_026_a02-037\line_5.jpg	essential services and ensure food supplies. Thus it
Crop_lines\1_handwritten_026_a02-037\line_6.jpg	becomes an offence punishable with imprisonment
Crop_lines\1_handwritten_026_a02-037\line_7.jpg	for anyone who "publishes a report likely to cause
Crop_lines\1_handwritten_026_a02-037\line_8.jpg	alarm or prejudicial to public safety.”
Crop_lines\2_handwritten_026_a02-042\line_0.jpg	And up to ten years’ imprisonment can be imposed
Crop_lines\2_handwritten_026_a02-042\line_1.jpg	on anyone convicted of sabotage. These stern measures
Crop_lines\2_handwritten_026_a02-042\line_2.jpg	had the desired effect today at Kumasi where the
Crop_lines\2_handwritten_026_a02-042\line_3.jpg	strikers gave in, but in Takoradi, the chief storm centre,
Crop_lines\2_handwritten_026_a02-042\line_4.jpg	they are still holding out despite the presence of 1,400
Crop_lines\2_handwritten_026_a02-042\line_5.jpg	police and 16 armoured cars. And how did the
Crop_lines\2_handwritten_026_a02-042\line_6.jpg	Government react when the strikers demonstrated in
Crop_lines\2_handwritten_026_a02-042\line_7.jpg	Accra?
Crop_lines\3_handwritten_026_a02-090\line_0.jpg	"It is true he made a point of again being absent
Crop_lines\3_handwritten_026_a02-090\line_1.jpg	from Northern Rhodesia when his followers here
Crop_lines\3_handwritten_026_a02-090\line_2.jpg	indulged in such violence.” But Sir Roy pointed out
Crop_lines\3_handwritten_026_a02-090\line_3.jpg	that a few months ago Mr. Kaunda said that
Crop_lines\3_handwritten_026_a02-090\line_4.jpg	if UNIP did not get its way what would happen
Crop_lines\3_handwritten_026_a02-090\line_5.jpg	would make the Mau Mau in Kenya ”seem like
Crop_lines\3_handwritten_026_a02-090\line_6.jpg	a child’s picnic.”
Crop_lines\4_handwritten_026_a02-093\line_0.jpg	JOHN DICKIE writes: Mr. Macmillan gave top
Crop_lines\4_handwritten_026_a02-093\line_1.jpg	priority to the clash over Northern Rhodesia on his
Crop_lines\4_handwritten_026_a02-093\line_2.jpg	return from Scotland yesterday. He summoned Mr.
Crop_lines\4_handwritten_026_a02-093\line_3.jpg	Iain Macleod, Colonial Secretary, and Mr. Duncan Sandys,
Crop_lines\4_handwritten_026_a02-093\line_4.jpg	Commonwealth Relations Secretary for an hour’s talks
Crop_lines\4_handwritten_026_a02-093\line_5.jpg	at Admiralty House. A statement is expected today
Crop_lines\4_handwritten_026_a02-093\line_6.jpg	to hold the door open for modifications to the
Crop_lines\4_handwritten_026_a02-093\line_7.jpg	new Constitution provided law and order is maintained
Crop_lines\4_handwritten_026_a02-093\line_8.jpg	in Northern Rhodesia.
Crop_lines\5_handwritten_026_a02-098\line_0.jpg	Its terms have set the Prime Minister an exacting
Crop_lines\5_handwritten_026_a02-098\line_1.jpg	problem. Mr. Sandys has warned of the risk of a
Crop_lines\5_handwritten_026_a02-098\line_2.jpg	strong reaction from Sir Roy Welensky to any
Crop_lines\5_handwritten_026_a02-098\line_3.jpg	suggestion that there may be fresh concessions to the
Crop_lines\5_handwritten_026_a02-098\line_4.jpg	African nationalists. Mr. Macleod has ample evidence
Crop_lines\5_handwritten_026_a02-098\line_5.jpg	from talks with Sir John Moffat, Northern Rhodesian
Crop_lines\5_handwritten_026_a02-098\line_6.jpg	Liberal leader, and Mr. Kaunda, that the bulk
Crop_lines\5_handwritten_026_a02-098\line_7.jpg	of moderates and Africans will reject the
Crop_lines\5_handwritten_026_a02-098\line_8.jpg	Constitution unless it is modified.
Crop_lines\6_handwritten_027_a02-046\line_0.jpg	At 9.40 Mr. Edusei, Minister of Transport and pro-
Crop_lines\6_handwritten_027_a02-046\line_1.jpg	bably the toughest man in Mr. Nkrumah’s team,
Crop_lines\6_handwritten_027_a02-046\line_2.jpg	drove up to the Kingsway Stores and faced the
Crop_lines\6_handwritten_027_a02-046\line_3.jpg	demonstrators, most of them shopgirls in overalls.
Crop_lines\6_handwritten_027_a02-046\line_4.jpg	"If you have not dispersed by ten o’clock,” he
Crop_lines\6_handwritten_027_a02-046\line_5.jpg	told them, 'the police will act.’ At five to ten
Crop_lines\6_handwritten_027_a02-046\line_6.jpg	a posse of police arrived and in less than
Crop_lines\6_handwritten_027_a02-046\line_7.jpg	two minutes the crowd had gone.
Crop_lines\7_handwritten_029_a02-053\line_0.jpg	It has been left, however, to Mr. Goka, Ghana’s Finance
Crop_lines\7_handwritten_029_a02-053\line_1.jpg	Minister, to do the honours as host, in which capacity
Crop_lines\7_handwritten_029_a02-053\line_2.jpg	he held a reception tonight in Accra’s Ambassador
Crop_lines\7_handwritten_029_a02-053\line_3.jpg	Hotel.POLICE, on direct orders from the Cabinet, are
Crop_lines\7_handwritten_029_a02-053\line_4.jpg	openly intimidating members of Earl Russell’s nuclear-
Crop_lines\7_handwritten_029_a02-053\line_5.jpg	disarming Committee of 100, the Committee claimed
Crop_lines\7_handwritten_029_a02-053\line_6.jpg	yesterday. It said pressure was being put on
Crop_lines\7_handwritten_029_a02-053\line_7.jpg	members and associates all over the country.
Crop_lines\8_handwritten_033_a02-072\line_0.jpg	"He is not going to agree to be bound over. That will
Crop_lines\8_handwritten_033_a02-072\line_1.jpg	probably mean jail and, though frail, he is very fit and
Crop_lines\8_handwritten_033_a02-072\line_2.jpg	will take the rigours of prison in his stride. He
Crop_lines\8_handwritten_033_a02-072\line_3.jpg	hopes to be allowed to do some writing.” Back at
Crop_lines\8_handwritten_033_a02-072\line_4.jpg	the Press conference, Mr. Clark said two committee
Crop_lines\8_handwritten_033_a02-072\line_5.jpg	members tried a ’plant” call on a suspect phone. They
Crop_lines\8_handwritten_033_a02-072\line_6.jpg	discussed a sit-down at Watford at 5.30 p.m. - none
Crop_lines\8_handwritten_033_a02-072\line_7.jpg	was planned but police turned up.
Crop_lines\9_handwritten_035_a02-082\line_0.jpg	He cited cases in which hundreds of UNIP supporters
Crop_lines\9_handwritten_035_a02-082\line_1.jpg	had been arrested or convicted since last year on
Crop_lines\9_handwritten_035_a02-082\line_2.jpg	charges of creating disturbances. During the first
Crop_lines\9_handwritten_035_a02-082\line_3.jpg	three weeks of the present trouble 287 incidents
Crop_lines\9_handwritten_035_a02-082\line_4.jpg	had been reported in Northern Rhodesia. More
Crop_lines\9_handwritten_035_a02-082\line_5.jpg	than 500 people - 167 of them members of
Crop_lines\9_handwritten_035_a02-082\line_6.jpg	the UNIP - were convicted last month in the
Crop_lines\9_handwritten_035_a02-082\line_7.jpg	Northern Province alone.
Crop_lines\10_handwritten_050_a03-037\line_0.jpg	Last year saw the defeat of two Conservative
Crop_lines\10_handwritten_050_a03-037\line_1.jpg	provincial governments, Quebec and New Brunswick, and
Crop_lines\10_handwritten_050_a03-037\line_2.jpg	in the four federal by-elections last October the party
Crop_lines\10_handwritten_050_a03-037\line_3.jpg	fared badly. They are now faced with four other by-
Crop_lines\10_handwritten_050_a03-037\line_4.jpg	elections, one at Esquimalt Saanich, British Columbia,
Crop_lines\10_handwritten_050_a03-037\line_5.jpg	one in Leeds, Ontario, and the other two in the
Crop_lines\10_handwritten_050_a03-037\line_6.jpg	Maritimes - Restigouche Madawaska, New Brunswick,
Crop_lines\10_handwritten_050_a03-037\line_7.jpg	and Kings, Prince Edward Island.
Crop_lines\11_handwritten_056_a03-066\line_0.jpg	Mr. Thorneycroft’s main purpose will be to
Crop_lines\11_handwritten_056_a03-066\line_1.jpg	remove these doubts, and to persuade the
Crop_lines\11_handwritten_056_a03-066\line_2.jpg	Federal Government that the financial burden
Crop_lines\11_handwritten_056_a03-066\line_3.jpg	involved is really worth while, at a time when
Crop_lines\11_handwritten_056_a03-066\line_4.jpg	any increase in budgetary commitments
Crop_lines\11_handwritten_056_a03-066\line_5.jpg	would almost certainly involve a corresponding
Crop_lines\11_handwritten_056_a03-066\line_6.jpg	rise in taxation - something no one is prepared
Crop_lines\11_handwritten_056_a03-066\line_7.jpg	to contemplate in an election year.
Crop_lines\12_handwritten_063_a04-081\line_0.jpg	The General Council of the Trades Unio
Crop_lines\12_handwritten_063_a04-081\line_1.jpg	Congress should therefore consider the
Crop_lines\12_handwritten_063_a04-081\line_2.jpg	matter. Consideration should also be given
Crop_lines\12_handwritten_063_a04-081\line_3.jpg	to the regrouping of unions and the
Crop_lines\12_handwritten_063_a04-081\line_4.jpg	modification of their structures to
Crop_lines\12_handwritten_063_a04-081\line_5.jpg	meet the growing concentration of
Crop_lines\12_handwritten_063_a04-081\line_6.jpg	capital. Mr. Cooper argued that a
Crop_lines\12_handwritten_063_a04-081\line_7.jpg	common industrial contribution was
Crop_lines\12_handwritten_063_a04-081\line_8.jpg	urgent - particularly in unions serving
Crop_lines\12_handwritten_063_a04-081\line_9.jpg	workers in the same industry - along
Crop_lines\13_handwritten_063_a04-085\line_0.jpg	Suggesting that a total T.U.C.
Crop_lines\13_handwritten_063_a04-085\line_1.jpg	membership of eight million was a ”’poor
Crop_lines\13_handwritten_063_a04-085\line_2.jpg	show” compared with some countries, he
Crop_lines\13_handwritten_063_a04-085\line_3.jpg	argued that the position needed examination.
Crop_lines\13_handwritten_063_a04-085\line_4.jpg	BEFORE President Kennedy met Mr.
Crop_lines\13_handwritten_063_a04-085\line_5.jpg	Macmillan yesterday morning he was given
Crop_lines\13_handwritten_063_a04-085\line_6.jpg	the views of a wide section of the
Crop_lines\13_handwritten_063_a04-085\line_7.jpg	British people about Polaris submarine
Crop_lines\13_handwritten_063_a04-085\line_8.jpg	bases in this country. An open letter
Crop_lines\13_handwritten_063_a04-085\line_9.jpg	written by Earl Russell hoping that the
Crop_lines\14_handwritten_063_a04-089\line_0.jpg	Earl Russell, President of the Committee
Crop_lines\14_handwritten_063_a04-089\line_1.jpg	of 100, told Kennedy that he should
Crop_lines\14_handwritten_063_a04-089\line_2.jpg	take notice of *that very large and
Crop_lines\14_handwritten_063_a04-089\line_3.jpg	growing section which is opposed to
Crop_lines\14_handwritten_063_a04-089\line_4.jpg	the establishment of a Polaris base,
Crop_lines\14_handwritten_063_a04-089\line_5.jpg	whether at Holy Loch or elsewhere on
Crop_lines\14_handwritten_063_a04-089\line_6.jpg	British territory.” He pointed out that
Crop_lines\14_handwritten_063_a04-089\line_7.jpg	already there have been protests but
Crop_lines\14_handwritten_063_a04-089\line_8.jpg	that” very much larger protests are to
Crop_lines\14_handwritten_063_a04-089\line_9.jpg	be expected and are being planned.”
Crop_lines\15_handwritten_064_a04-092\line_0.jpg	There are three kinds of reasons that justify
Crop_lines\15_handwritten_064_a04-092\line_1.jpg	the protests and these should carry weight with
Crop_lines\15_handwritten_064_a04-092\line_2.jpg	the U.S. Government, Earl Russell suggested. ”The
Crop_lines\15_handwritten_064_a04-092\line_3.jpg	first of these reasons is the importance of pre-
Crop_lines\15_handwritten_064_a04-092\line_4.jpg	serving the hitherto cordial relations between the
Crop_lines\15_handwritten_064_a04-092\line_5.jpg	U.S. and Great Britain, not only in Government
Crop_lines\15_handwritten_064_a04-092\line_6.jpg	circles, but in public opinion.” Earl Russell
Crop_lines\15_handwritten_064_a04-092\line_7.jpg	says it is inevitable, though profoundly
Crop_lines\15_handwritten_064_a04-092\line_8.jpg	regrettable, that the agitation against
Crop_lines\15_handwritten_064_a04-092\line_9.jpg	the Polaris base has generated some antagonism
Crop_lines\15_handwritten_064_a04-092\line_10.jpg	to the policy of the United States.
Crop_lines\16_handwritten_064_a04-096\line_0.jpg	The second reason is concerned with doubts
Crop_lines\16_handwritten_064_a04-096\line_1.jpg	as to the safety of the people of Great Britain;
Crop_lines\16_handwritten_064_a04-096\line_2.jpg	”in a time of crisis it would probably be
Crop_lines\16_handwritten_064_a04-096\line_3.jpg	impossible for the British authorities to
Crop_lines\16_handwritten_064_a04-096\line_4.jpg	exercise any degree of control over the action
Crop_lines\16_handwritten_064_a04-096\line_5.jpg	of Polaris submarines.” He argues that
Crop_lines\16_handwritten_064_a04-096\line_6.jpg	there is a distinct possibility that so long
Crop_lines\16_handwritten_064_a04-096\line_7.jpg	as there is a Polaris base in Britain the
Crop_lines\16_handwritten_064_a04-096\line_8.jpg	Soviet Union might retaliate against
Crop_lines\16_handwritten_064_a04-096\line_9.jpg	Britain alone.
Crop_lines\17_handwritten_064_a04-099\line_0.jpg	”Such retaliation might, and probably would,
Crop_lines\17_handwritten_064_a04-099\line_1.jpg	destroy the whole population of Britain in
Crop_lines\17_handwritten_064_a04-099\line_2.jpg	the course of, at the most, an hour” without
Crop_lines\17_handwritten_064_a04-099\line_3.jpg	provoking American retaliation. Earl Russell
Crop_lines\17_handwritten_064_a04-099\line_4.jpg	believes: ”It is very questionable whether
Crop_lines\17_handwritten_064_a04-099\line_5.jpg	British membership of Nato and British
Crop_lines\17_handwritten_064_a04-099\line_6.jpg	permission of American bases on our territory
Crop_lines\17_handwritten_064_a04-099\line_7.jpg	add anything to the strength of America,
Crop_lines\17_handwritten_064_a04-099\line_8.jpg	while, on the contrary, they impose upon
Crop_lines\17_handwritten_064_a04-099\line_9.jpg	America an onerous obligation which it
Crop_lines\17_handwritten_064_a04-099\line_10.jpg	may prove impossible to fulfil.”
Crop_lines\18_handwritten_064_a04-103\line_0.jpg	The third reason is that the supreme
Crop_lines\18_handwritten_064_a04-103\line_1.jpg	interest for the whole world - East and
Crop_lines\18_handwritten_064_a04-103\line_2.jpg	West and uncommitted nations - is the
Crop_lines\18_handwritten_064_a04-103\line_3.jpg	prevention of nuclear war. ”A rapidly
Crop_lines\18_handwritten_064_a04-103\line_4.jpg	growing body of opinion in this country
Crop_lines\18_handwritten_064_a04-103\line_5.jpg	believes that Britain could be more effective
Crop_lines\18_handwritten_064_a04-103\line_6.jpg	in preventing a nuclear war as a neutral
Crop_lines\18_handwritten_064_a04-103\line_7.jpg	by helping to suggest agreements which could
Crop_lines\18_handwritten_064_a04-103\line_8.jpg	be accepted by both East and West.”
Crop_lines\19_handwritten_065_a05-004\line_0.jpg	Short of wearing the same uniform, which is
Crop_lines\19_handwritten_065_a05-004\line_1.jpg	not contemplated, the Navy, Army and Royal
Crop_lines\19_handwritten_065_a05-004\line_2.jpg	Air Force would become, for practical purposes,
Crop_lines\19_handwritten_065_a05-004\line_3.jpg	a single defence force. There would be
Crop_lines\19_handwritten_065_a05-004\line_4.jpg	complete co-operation at all levels in training
Crop_lines\19_handwritten_065_a05-004\line_5.jpg	and operations. This would apply also in the
Crop_lines\19_handwritten_065_a05-004\line_6.jpg	command structure and central administrative
Crop_lines\19_handwritten_065_a05-004\line_7.jpg	organisation. Mr.Watkinson, Minister of Defence,
Crop_lines\19_handwritten_065_a05-004\line_8.jpg	has been working on the plan for some months,
Crop_lines\19_handwritten_065_a05-004\line_9.jpg	with the Prime Minister’s approval.
Crop_lines\20_handwritten_065_a05-009\line_0.jpg	He has had numerous meetings with the Service
Crop_lines\20_handwritten_065_a05-009\line_1.jpg	Ministers. He has also had talks with the Earl
Crop_lines\20_handwritten_065_a05-009\line_2.jpg	of Home, Foreign Secretary, and with other
Crop_lines\20_handwritten_065_a05-009\line_3.jpg	Ministers concerned with overseas aspects
Crop_lines\20_handwritten_065_a05-009\line_4.jpg	of defence policy. Details of the scheme
Crop_lines\20_handwritten_065_a05-009\line_5.jpg	are now being worked out by the Chiefs
Crop_lines\20_handwritten_065_a05-009\line_6.jpg	of Staff, a process that may take four
Crop_lines\20_handwritten_065_a05-009\line_7.jpg	or five months.
Crop_lines\21_handwritten_067_a06-008\line_0.jpg	Mr. Harold Wilson, Shadow Chancellor, jumped up to
Crop_lines\21_handwritten_067_a06-008\line_1.jpg	offer the Government an easy passage for such
Crop_lines\21_handwritten_067_a06-008\line_2.jpg	legislation. ”Why don’t you make proposals to legislate
Crop_lines\21_handwritten_067_a06-008\line_3.jpg	in the autumn?” Mr. Wilson asked. ”We wouldn’t call
Crop_lines\21_handwritten_067_a06-008\line_4.jpg	it an Autumn Budget. You can call it a Taxation
Crop_lines\21_handwritten_067_a06-008\line_5.jpg	Management Bill, if you like.” While Mr. Wilson
Crop_lines\21_handwritten_067_a06-008\line_6.jpg	was speaking, the Prime Minister and Mr. Lloyd
Crop_lines\21_handwritten_067_a06-008\line_7.jpg	had a whispered conversation.
Crop_lines\22_handwritten_075_a06-057\line_0.jpg	This seemed to infuriate Mr. Fell even more. ”I cannot be told
Crop_lines\22_handwritten_075_a06-057\line_1.jpg	to sit down by the Prime Minister.” Protests had been expected
Crop_lines\22_handwritten_075_a06-057\line_2.jpg	from Tory rebels. But Mr. Fell’s attack was unprecedented. He
Crop_lines\22_handwritten_075_a06-057\line_3.jpg	accused the Prime Minister of ” political double talk.” "It had
Crop_lines\22_handwritten_075_a06-057\line_4.jpg	the effect on one former supporter that he now thinks this Prime
Crop_lines\22_handwritten_075_a06-057\line_5.jpg	Minister is a national disaster,” he said.
Crop_lines\23_handwritten_090_b01-049\line_0.jpg	There they have stayed uselessly locked up because
Crop_lines\23_handwritten_090_b01-049\line_1.jpg	Germany has no tradition of trading abroad. In addition
Crop_lines\23_handwritten_090_b01-049\line_2.jpg	the strength of Germany’s trading position has attracted
Crop_lines\23_handwritten_090_b01-049\line_3.jpg	speculators to hold marks rather than pounds or dollars,
Crop_lines\23_handwritten_090_b01-049\line_4.jpg	hoping for the mark to rise, as has now happened.
Crop_lines\23_handwritten_090_b01-049\line_5.jpg	WILL the new valuation be enough to correct
Crop_lines\23_handwritten_090_b01-049\line_6.jpg	Germany’s massive trading surplus and choke
Crop_lines\23_handwritten_090_b01-049\line_7.jpg	off speculation against dollar and pound?
Crop_lines\24_handwritten_090_b01-053\line_0.jpg	That is doubtful. If, however, in addition to her new
Crop_lines\24_handwritten_090_b01-053\line_1.jpg	good-neighbour gesture, Germany takes a really big
Crop_lines\24_handwritten_090_b01-053\line_2.jpg	share in giving aid to underdeveloped nations, the
Crop_lines\24_handwritten_090_b01-053\line_3.jpg	world outlook will be brighter. What gives rise
Crop_lines\24_handwritten_090_b01-053\line_4.jpg	to optimism is the sign that Germany and the
Crop_lines\24_handwritten_090_b01-053\line_5.jpg	other leading Western nations are at long last
Crop_lines\24_handwritten_090_b01-053\line_6.jpg	moving towards a solution of currency problems
Crop_lines\24_handwritten_090_b01-053\line_7.jpg	by co-operation.
Crop_lines\25_handwritten_091_b01-079\line_0.jpg	It is unjust to pass the buck to Mr.
Crop_lines\25_handwritten_091_b01-079\line_1.jpg	Hammarskjold and the UN’s servants. The
Crop_lines\25_handwritten_091_b01-079\line_2.jpg	responsibility rightly belongs to the nations
Crop_lines\25_handwritten_091_b01-079\line_3.jpg	which have undertaken the task of pre-
Crop_lines\25_handwritten_091_b01-079\line_4.jpg	serving peace in the Congo. That is not a
Crop_lines\25_handwritten_091_b01-079\line_5.jpg	ceremonial duty, and the soldiers have every
Crop_lines\25_handwritten_091_b01-079\line_6.jpg	right to blame the politicians unless they see
Crop_lines\25_handwritten_091_b01-079\line_7.jpg	it through. When the United Nations instructed
Crop_lines\25_handwritten_091_b01-079\line_8.jpg	Mr. Hammarskjold to use force if necessary to
Crop_lines\25_handwritten_091_b01-079\line_9.jpg	prevent civil war, it was clear that new dangers
Crop_lines\25_handwritten_091_b01-079\line_10.jpg	would arise unless it gave him the political...
Crop_lines\26_handwritten_096_b02-045\line_0.jpg	Formula One, which appeared in February, appeared to make
Crop_lines\26_handwritten_096_b02-045\line_1.jpg	this likely; Formula Two, which appeared in June, made it
Crop_lines\26_handwritten_096_b02-045\line_2.jpg	very unlikely; if Formula Three restores the original
Crop_lines\26_handwritten_096_b02-045\line_3.jpg	principle, that is all that need be required of it. It is a pity
Crop_lines\26_handwritten_096_b02-045\line_4.jpg	that the Government should ever have been led away
Crop_lines\26_handwritten_096_b02-045\line_5.jpg	from this principle. It is a great pity that the
Crop_lines\26_handwritten_096_b02-045\line_6.jpg	Government should give the appearance of responding, not
Crop_lines\26_handwritten_096_b02-045\line_7.jpg	to Mr Kaunda’s reasonable representations, but to
Crop_lines\26_handwritten_096_b02-045\line_8.jpg	the violence which he tried to prevent.
Crop_lines\27_handwritten_098_b02-102\line_0.jpg	To Germany’s Western allies the campaign has been a
Crop_lines\27_handwritten_098_b02-102\line_1.jpg	millstone weighing down and almost paralysing their
Crop_lines\27_handwritten_098_b02-102\line_2.jpg	efforts to work out sensible ways of dealing with
Crop_lines\27_handwritten_098_b02-102\line_3.jpg	the Berlin crisis. It need not have been such a burden
Crop_lines\27_handwritten_098_b02-102\line_4.jpg	if Western Governments had not been convinced
Crop_lines\27_handwritten_098_b02-102\line_5.jpg	that they must do nothing to harm even remotely Dr
Crop_lines\27_handwritten_098_b02-102\line_6.jpg	Adenauer’s chances of being returned as Chancellor.
Crop_lines\28_handwritten_109_b04-060\line_0.jpg	It is equally certain that the British Government
Crop_lines\28_handwritten_109_b04-060\line_1.jpg	will welcome them. How splendid it would be if, just
Crop_lines\28_handwritten_109_b04-060\line_2.jpg	for once, the Government were to voice the real feelings of
Crop_lines\28_handwritten_109_b04-060\line_3.jpg	the British people. And tell Makarios they are not
Crop_lines\28_handwritten_109_b04-060\line_4.jpg	prepared to accept him on such terms. GOOD cheer
Crop_lines\28_handwritten_109_b04-060\line_5.jpg	for the week-end. Ford Motors are to put 13,000
Crop_lines\28_handwritten_109_b04-060\line_6.jpg	men back on a five-day week.

Crop_lines\29_handwritten_109_b04-066\line_1.jpg	springtime approaches, orders pick up. And the car men get
Crop_lines\29_handwritten_109_b04-066\line_2.jpg	ready for another bustling season. The pessimists
Crop_lines\29_handwritten_109_b04-066\line_3.jpg	said the motor industry was on its knees. The optimists
Crop_lines\29_handwritten_109_b04-066\line_4.jpg	said ’ Nonsense.” As usual, the optimists have been
Crop_lines\29_handwritten_109_b04-066\line_5.jpg	proved right. EARL RUSSELL and his friends have

Crop_lines\30_handwritten_128_b06-071\line_4.jpg	Gaitskell’s stupid hope. The tragedy is
Crop_lines\30_handwritten_128_b06-071\line_5.jpg	that enormous inroads could already
Crop_lines\30_handwritten_128_b06-071\line_6.jpg	have been made into Tory strength by

Crop_lines\31_handwritten_128_c06-027\line_1.jpg	the advantage that no one knows what
Crop_lines\31_handwritten_128_c06-027\line_2.jpg	you’re writing about anyway. ”Not that I did
Crop_lines\31_handwritten_128_c06-027\line_3.jpg	much when I was over this past two times,

Crop_lines\33_handwritten_138_c02-003\line_0.jpg	It would now seem that Wicki’s name must
Crop_lines\33_handwritten_138_c02-003\line_1.jpg	be added to this list, for his new film
Crop_lines\33_handwritten_138_c02-003\line_2.jpg	may well be a landmark in the revitali-
Crop_lines\33_handwritten_138_c02-003\line_3.jpg	sation of the German cinema. Wicki is
Crop_lines\33_handwritten_138_c02-003\line_4.jpg	not only a director. He began his career
Crop_lines\33_handwritten_138_c02-003\line_5.jpg	as an actor, had his first important
Crop_lines\33_handwritten_138_c02-003\line_6.jpg	film ro*?5le in Ka”utner’s ” Die letzt

Crop_lines\34_handwritten_150_c03-016a\line_0.jpg	But there is heart in the telling, and an
Crop_lines\34_handwritten_150_c03-016a\line_1.jpg	intense realism in the situation. A young
Crop_lines\34_handwritten_150_c03-016a\line_2.jpg	girl lives in a single dingy room with
Crop_lines\34_handwritten_150_c03-016a\line_3.jpg	her slatternly, promiscuous mother. In such
Crop_lines\34_handwritten_150_c03-016a\line_4.jpg	surroundings she learns sex is something
Crop_lines\34_handwritten_150_c03-016a\line_5.jpg	sordid, and when she experiences it for the
Crop_lines\34_handwritten_150_c03-016a\line_6.jpg	first time herself it is incoherently, clumsily,
Crop_lines\34_handwritten_150_c03-016a\line_7.jpg	but half inquisitively. As is the case in Fanny
Crop_lines\34_handwritten_150_c03-016a\line_8.jpg	her first lover is a sailor who leaves her
Crop_lines\34_handwritten_150_c03-016a\line_9.jpg	to bear his child and sails away.
Crop_lines\35_handwritten_150_c03-021a\line_0.jpg	In Fanny the pregnant girl is befriended by
Crop_lines\35_handwritten_150_c03-021a\line_1.jpg	an old man. Here it is a young homosexual,
Crop_lines\35_handwritten_150_c03-021a\line_2.jpg	estranged from women but yet moved by a
Crop_lines\35_handwritten_150_c03-021a\line_3.jpg	strong maternal instinct to the unborn child
Crop_lines\35_handwritten_150_c03-021a\line_4.jpg	as much as to the expectant mother, who acts
Crop_lines\35_handwritten_150_c03-021a\line_5.jpg	as a protector and comforter to her in her
Crop_lines\35_handwritten_150_c03-021a\line_6.jpg	hour of need. He shares her room and gives
Crop_lines\35_handwritten_150_c03-021a\line_7.jpg	her his forlorn gift of companionship and sym-
Crop_lines\35_handwritten_150_c03-021a\line_8.jpg	pathy - ”you need someone to love you while
Crop_lines\35_handwritten_150_c03-021a\line_9.jpg	you are looking for someone to love”.
Crop_lines\36_handwritten_156_c03-007\line_0.jpg	In A Taste of Honey Mr. Richardson has taken

Crop_lines\36_handwritten_156_c03-007\line_2.jpg	and has made it live. The shabby streets
Crop_lines\36_handwritten_156_c03-007\line_3.jpg	and wet pavements, the school play-grounds,
Crop_lines\36_handwritten_156_c03-007\line_4.jpg	the public monuments and the rubbish
Crop_lines\36_handwritten_156_c03-007\line_5.jpg	strewn canals - even the worn head-stones
Crop_lines\36_handwritten_156_c03-007\line_6.jpg	in the churchyard, ”sacred to the memory of”
Crop_lines\36_handwritten_156_c03-007\line_7.jpg	- are seen as an integral part of the story.
Crop_lines\37_handwritten_164_c04-075\line_0.jpg	Thus, musician David Lisbon’s chances of being a starred
Crop_lines\37_handwritten_164_c04-075\line_1.jpg	disc solo pianist were greatly enhanced when he dug out
Crop_lines\37_handwritten_164_c04-075\line_2.jpg	A PACKET OF DRAWING-PINS. ” Why not,” thought ex-soldier
Crop_lines\37_handwritten_164_c04-075\line_3.jpg	Mr. Lisbon, who is twenty-three, and lives in Dagenham, Essex,
Crop_lines\37_handwritten_164_c04-075\line_4.jpg	” press a thumb-tack into the nose of the hammers that strike
Crop_lines\37_handwritten_164_c04-075\line_5.jpg	the piano strings?” He did, on his piano at home. There weren’t
Crop_lines\37_handwritten_164_c04-075\line_6.jpg	enough tacks and he got only the middle hammers done.
Crop_lines\38_handwritten_172_c04-165\line_0.jpg	The film replaced ”What’s My Line?” and ”Be My

Crop_lines\38_handwritten_172_c04-165\line_2.jpg	strike. It showed Britain today through the eyes
Crop_lines\38_handwritten_172_c04-165\line_3.jpg	of an American TV reporter, Eric Sevareid, and
Crop_lines\38_handwritten_172_c04-165\line_4.jpg	British personalities. Among them - Professor
Crop_lines\38_handwritten_172_c04-165\line_5.jpg	Dennis Brogan, Shelagh Delaney, and Alan Sillitoe.
Crop_lines\38_handwritten_172_c04-165\line_6.jpg	The film covered a wide aspect of the British
Crop_lines\38_handwritten_172_c04-165\line_7.jpg	scene, ranging from pubs, the Eton wall game,
Crop_lines\38_handwritten_172_c04-165\line_8.jpg	to the European Common Market.
Crop_lines\39_handwritten_172_c04-170\line_0.jpg	Shelagh Delaney and Alan Sillitoe attacked
Crop_lines\39_handwritten_172_c04-170\line_1.jpg	education. It was left to reporter Sevareid
Crop_lines\39_handwritten_172_c04-170\line_2.jpg	to make the strongest criticisms. He said
Crop_lines\39_handwritten_172_c04-170\line_3.jpg	that in the race of the modern nations,
Crop_lines\39_handwritten_172_c04-170\line_4.jpg	Britain was slipping behind....
Crop_lines\40_handwritten_184_d04-008\line_0.jpg	The Talmud describes that the Shamir lives in
Crop_lines\40_handwritten_184_d04-008\line_1.jpg	a sanctuary, and only some rare birds know
Crop_lines\40_handwritten_184_d04-008\line_2.jpg	the existence of it. These birds are, the Cherubim
Crop_lines\40_handwritten_184_d04-008\line_3.jpg	and the Seraphim. We are also told that the Shamir
Crop_lines\40_handwritten_184_d04-008\line_4.jpg	is the stylus used by Moses, and this stylus is described
Crop_lines\40_handwritten_184_d04-008\line_5.jpg	as a very precious diamond-stone and very adamant.
Crop_lines\41_handwritten_188_d04-047\line_0.jpg	Under such conditions without putting your
Crop_lines\41_handwritten_188_d04-047\line_1.jpg	mind together we cannot solve the further
Crop_lines\41_handwritten_188_d04-047\line_2.jpg	summons of destiny, to solve the economic
Crop_lines\41_handwritten_188_d04-047\line_3.jpg	problems. Hence says Rabbi Simeon ben
Crop_lines\41_handwritten_188_d04-047\line_4.jpg	Jochai (Tanis 6a) ”if Israel does not fulfil
Crop_lines\41_handwritten_188_d04-047\line_5.jpg	the wish of the Lord, failing to serve the
Crop_lines\41_handwritten_188_d04-047\line_6.jpg	Lord God with all their visionary power,
Crop_lines\41_handwritten_188_d04-047\line_7.jpg	the work will have to be done by each

Crop_lines\42_handwritten_202_e06-037\line_0.jpg	The East Anglian behaviour (see p. 82)
Crop_lines\42_handwritten_202_e06-037\line_1.jpg	has always differed from that of the
Crop_lines\42_handwritten_202_e06-037\line_2.jpg	summer fisheries. There is the ”swim”
Crop_lines\42_handwritten_202_e06-037\line_3.jpg	at slack waters, even in daylight
Crop_lines\42_handwritten_202_e06-037\line_4.jpg	sometimes; and the high swimming,
Crop_lines\42_handwritten_202_e06-037\line_5.jpg	when fish are caught only in the top
Crop_lines\42_handwritten_202_e06-037\line_6.jpg	few yards of netting. These and other
Crop_lines\42_handwritten_202_e06-037\line_7.jpg	fascinating behaviour mysteries are peculiar
Crop_lines\42_handwritten_202_e06-037\line_8.jpg	to this fishery, which unfortunately seems
Crop_lines\42_handwritten_202_e06-037\line_9.jpg	to be dying out; but a full discussion of
Crop_lines\42_handwritten_202_e06-037\line_10.jpg	them is beyond the present scope.

Crop_lines\43_handwritten_202_e06-041\line_1.jpg	that all fishing gear, when moving,
Crop_lines\43_handwritten_202_e06-041\line_2.jpg	sends before it a kind of scaring effect,
Crop_lines\43_handwritten_202_e06-041\line_3.jpg	probably through waves or vibrations in
Crop_lines\43_handwritten_202_e06-041\line_4.jpg	the water or along the ground.
Crop_lines\43_handwritten_202_e06-041\line_5.jpg	Underwater films suggest that the
Crop_lines\43_handwritten_202_e06-041\line_6.jpg	footrope of a trawl does this. Films
Crop_lines\43_handwritten_202_e06-041\line_7.jpg	have also shown plaice moving before

Crop_lines\44_handwritten_253_f01-075\line_0.jpg	At one time it was thought that mind could indeed
Crop_lines\44_handwritten_253_f01-075\line_1.jpg	be analysed into discrete bits. These bits were
Crop_lines\44_handwritten_253_f01-075\line_2.jpg	identified as elementary sensations. These were
Crop_lines\44_handwritten_253_f01-075\line_3.jpg	thought to combine together to form compound
Crop_lines\44_handwritten_253_f01-075\line_4.jpg	experiences by analogy with the way atoms of
Crop_lines\44_handwritten_253_f01-075\line_5.jpg	matter combine to form molecular compounds.
Crop_lines\44_handwritten_253_f01-075\line_6.jpg	But this view led to too many difficulties and
Crop_lines\44_handwritten_253_f01-075\line_7.jpg	was finally abandoned. Nevertheless the search
Crop_lines\44_handwritten_253_f01-075\line_8.jpg	for basic units of mind has gone on and will
Crop_lines\44_handwritten_253_f01-075\line_9.jpg	doubtless continue, for it is the aim of science to
Crop_lines\44_handwritten_253_f01-075\line_10.jpg	discover ultimate units.

Crop_lines\45_handwritten_260_f02-020\line_4.jpg	discussions are arranged for the wives in addition to the
Crop_lines\45_handwritten_260_f02-020\line_5.jpg	plenary sessions. Of the men reaching fifty years of age
Crop_lines\45_handwritten_260_f02-020\line_6.jpg	since the scheme started, 125 (37.2 per cent) have

Crop_lines\46_handwritten_288_f07-021a\line_0.jpg	Does one, however, know who first thought of boiling
Crop_lines\46_handwritten_288_f07-021a\line_1.jpg	water and food? The ancient Britons, I believe, used to
Crop_lines\46_handwritten_288_f07-021a\line_2.jpg	make water hot by dropping a red-hot poker into it,
Crop_lines\46_handwritten_288_f07-021a\line_3.jpg	because their pots would not stand fire; but Jacob
Crop_lines\46_handwritten_288_f07-021a\line_4.jpg	must have had one that would, because Esau sold

Crop_lines\47_handwritten_288_f07-024a\line_4.jpg	how to do it, too: - When the languid flames at
Crop_lines\47_handwritten_288_f07-024a\line_5.jpg	length subside, He throws a bed of glowing

Crop_lines\48_handwritten_292_f07-088a\line_0.jpg	A fascinating study also opens up in
Crop_lines\48_handwritten_292_f07-088a\line_1.jpg	the dietary welcomed by men of genius
Crop_lines\48_handwritten_292_f07-088a\line_2.jpg	as well as the foods for which they have
Crop_lines\48_handwritten_292_f07-088a\line_3.jpg	had an aversion. Shelley, for example,
Crop_lines\48_handwritten_292_f07-088a\line_4.jpg	had a great contempt for animal
Crop_lines\48_handwritten_292_f07-088a\line_5.jpg	food, believing that it impaired the
Crop_lines\48_handwritten_292_f07-088a\line_6.jpg	intellectual faculties. Bunyan’s break-
Crop_lines\48_handwritten_292_f07-088a\line_7.jpg	fast and supper consisted of a
Crop_lines\48_handwritten_292_f07-088a\line_8.jpg	piece of coarse bread and a
Crop_lines\48_handwritten_292_f07-088a\line_9.jpg	bowl of milk.
Crop_lines\49_handwritten_292_f07-092a\line_0.jpg	Dante Gabriel Rossetti had simple tastes
Crop_lines\49_handwritten_292_f07-092a\line_1.jpg	in food. At one dinner he is said to have
Crop_lines\49_handwritten_292_f07-092a\line_2.jpg	been blind to the charms of turbot and
Crop_lines\49_handwritten_292_f07-092a\line_3.jpg	to have been much more interested
Crop_lines\49_handwritten_292_f07-092a\line_4.jpg	in the dish in which it was served. He
Crop_lines\49_handwritten_292_f07-092a\line_5.jpg	turned it over on the table cloth to
Crop_lines\49_handwritten_292_f07-092a\line_6.jpg	examine the marks on the back
Crop_lines\49_handwritten_292_f07-092a\line_7.jpg	without going through the formality
Crop_lines\49_handwritten_292_f07-092a\line_8.jpg	of having his turbot removed first.
Crop_lines\50_handwritten_109_b04-075\line_0.jpg	They intend to sit outside the Ministry of Defence. It is
Crop_lines\50_handwritten_109_b04-075\line_1.jpg	their protest against the H-bomb. They ought to have a
Crop_lines\50_handwritten_109_b04-075\line_2.jpg	pleasant time. The weather forecast is good; except for them,
Crop_lines\50_handwritten_109_b04-075\line_3.jpg	Whitehall should be deserted. And they will have a fine view
Crop_lines\50_handwritten_109_b04-075\line_4.jpg	of St. James’s Park, with its placid lake, pelicans,
Crop_lines\50_handwritten_109_b04-075\line_5.jpg	rare ducks, and other wild life.
Crop_lines\51_handwritten_124_b06-049\line_0.jpg	When Scarborough carried our point of view
Crop_lines\51_handwritten_124_b06-049\line_1.jpg	we were naturally delighted, more so because
Crop_lines\51_handwritten_124_b06-049\line_2.jpg	the alternatives had been put clearly to the
Crop_lines\51_handwritten_124_b06-049\line_3.jpg	movement, which had then chosen a vigorous
Crop_lines\51_handwritten_124_b06-049\line_4.jpg	anti-Nato, anti-Tory, anti-bomb and anti-German
Crop_lines\51_handwritten_124_b06-049\line_5.jpg	rearmament policy. Hopes rose as we saw a
Crop_lines\51_handwritten_124_b06-049\line_6.jpg	perspective of sharp struggle based on consistent
Crop_lines\51_handwritten_124_b06-049\line_7.jpg	lines of difference with the Tories. Many members
Crop_lines\51_handwritten_124_b06-049\line_8.jpg	understood that the bread-and-butter struggles
Crop_lines\51_handwritten_124_b06-049\line_9.jpg	of the union would become easier in the context
Crop_lines\52_handwritten_124_b06-075\line_0.jpg	At the same time that unity cannot be
Crop_lines\52_handwritten_124_b06-075\line_1.jpg	established on a false basis, or by creating
Crop_lines\52_handwritten_124_b06-075\line_2.jpg	further confusion within the movement. Unity
Crop_lines\52_handwritten_124_b06-075\line_3.jpg	will never be established on the basis of leaders
Crop_lines\52_handwritten_124_b06-075\line_4.jpg	being a law unto themselves and opposing
Crop_lines\52_handwritten_124_b06-075\line_5.jpg	conference decisions when it suits their own
Crop_lines\52_handwritten_124_b06-075\line_6.jpg	convenience. Unity can never be established by
Crop_lines\52_handwritten_124_b06-075\line_7.jpg	any formula uniting those who oppose German
Crop_lines\52_handwritten_124_b06-075\line_8.jpg	troops being trained on British soil and Polaris,
Crop_lines\52_handwritten_124_b06-075\line_9.jpg	and those who are for this policy - which is the
Crop_lines\52_handwritten_124_b06-075\line_10.jpg	same as that of the Tory Government.
Crop_lines\53_handwritten_124_c06-111\line_0.jpg	This sort of situation calls for some subtle,
Crop_lines\53_handwritten_124_c06-111\line_1.jpg	slightly sardonic handling. It doesn’t get it. But
Crop_lines\53_handwritten_124_c06-111\line_2.jpg	The Marriage-Go-Round is not entirely a waste of
Crop_lines\53_handwritten_124_c06-111\line_3.jpg	time. I learned from it that in the Institutes of Advanced
Crop_lines\53_handwritten_124_c06-111\line_4.jpg	Studies attached to some American universities
Crop_lines\53_handwritten_124_c06-111\line_5.jpg	the subject Social Psychology used to be called
Crop_lines\53_handwritten_124_c06-111\line_6.jpg	Home-making and is now known as Domestic
Crop_lines\53_handwritten_124_c06-111\line_7.jpg	Relations.
Crop_lines\54_handwritten_128_b06-019\line_0.jpg	The process has been too slow for Herr
Crop_lines\54_handwritten_128_b06-019\line_1.jpg	Strauss and last month he attacked
Crop_lines\54_handwritten_128_b06-019\line_2.jpg	Britain for being an obstacle for West Germany’s
Crop_lines\54_handwritten_128_b06-019\line_3.jpg	plans for a ” unified supply apparatus”
Crop_lines\54_handwritten_128_b06-019\line_4.jpg	in Nato. (A supply apparatus which would
Crop_lines\54_handwritten_128_b06-019\line_5.jpg	link together the various West German
Crop_lines\54_handwritten_128_b06-019\line_6.jpg	” facilities.” ) By the end of the year there
Crop_lines\54_handwritten_128_b06-019\line_7.jpg	will be 11 German divisions in Nato
Crop_lines\54_handwritten_128_b06-019\line_8.jpg	compared with four divisions of
Crop_lines\54_handwritten_128_b06-019\line_9.jpg	British troops.
Crop_lines\55_handwritten_128_c06-076\line_0.jpg	I AM happy to report that I saw some-
Crop_lines\55_handwritten_128_c06-076\line_1.jpg	thing this week I have never before witnessed,
Crop_lines\55_handwritten_128_c06-076\line_2.jpg	either in pictures or outside - a budgerigar
Crop_lines\55_handwritten_128_c06-076\line_3.jpg	playing a drunk scene, and playing it with
Crop_lines\55_handwritten_128_c06-076\line_4.jpg	perfect timing and technique. It gives one loud,
Crop_lines\55_handwritten_128_c06-076\line_5.jpg	clear hiccup and falls flat on its back. This
Crop_lines\55_handwritten_128_c06-076\line_6.jpg	brilliant budge, I may add, gets no credit
Crop_lines\55_handwritten_128_c06-076\line_7.jpg	in the cast list of Come September (Odeon,
Crop_lines\55_handwritten_128_c06-076\line_8.jpg	Leicester-square), which suggests that it
Crop_lines\55_handwritten_128_c06-076\line_9.jpg	is either using a stand-in for the stunt
Crop_lines\56_handwritten_128_c06-128\line_0.jpg	ON a March evening in 1932 in the New
Crop_lines\56_handwritten_128_c06-128\line_1.jpg	Jersey family household the nursemaid
Crop_lines\56_handwritten_128_c06-128\line_2.jpg	tiptoed into the baby’s room to see that
Crop_lines\56_handwritten_128_c06-128\line_3.jpg	20-month-old Charles Jun. was sleeping.
Crop_lines\56_handwritten_128_c06-128\line_4.jpg	Bending over the cot, she suddenly realised
Crop_lines\56_handwritten_128_c06-128\line_5.jpg	that there was no sound of breathing.
Crop_lines\56_handwritten_128_c06-128\line_6.jpg	She thrust out her hand - and felt
Crop_lines\56_handwritten_128_c06-128\line_7.jpg	emptiness. A FEW minutes later the father
Crop_lines\56_handwritten_128_c06-128\line_8.jpg	gripping a loaded rifle, told his wife:
Crop_lines\57_handwritten_131_b06-042\line_0.jpg	A policy which breaks with military
Crop_lines\57_handwritten_131_b06-042\line_1.jpg	alliances like Nato and seeks friendship

Crop_lines\58_handwritten_131_b06-068\line_0.jpg	All recent events show how correct the
Crop_lines\58_handwritten_131_b06-068\line_1.jpg	Scarborough decisions were. The Kennedy
Crop_lines\58_handwritten_131_b06-068\line_2.jpg	Administration’s sharpened policies, the
Crop_lines\58_handwritten_131_b06-068\line_3.jpg	speeded-up drive to improve West
Crop_lines\58_handwritten_131_b06-068\line_4.jpg	Germany’s armament, the new attempt
Crop_lines\58_handwritten_131_b06-068\line_5.jpg	to rush Britain into the European Common
Crop_lines\58_handwritten_131_b06-068\line_6.jpg	Market, and the kite-flying on Spain
Crop_lines\58_handwritten_131_b06-068\line_7.jpg	present a whole new proof that to abandon
Crop_lines\58_handwritten_131_b06-068\line_8.jpg	Scarborough is to expose Britain and her
Crop_lines\58_handwritten_131_b06-068\line_9.jpg	working class to sharp new dangers - that
Crop_lines\58_handwritten_131_b06-068\line_10.jpg	Gaitskellism is bankrupt.
Crop_lines\59_handwritten_131_c06-058\line_0.jpg	It is ribald, funny, brilliantly observant
Crop_lines\59_handwritten_131_c06-058\line_1.jpg	of character, and authentic as a glass
Crop_lines\59_handwritten_131_c06-058\line_2.jpg	of draught porter. But will we see its
Crop_lines\59_handwritten_131_c06-058\line_3.jpg	end? The last scene of this fragment
Crop_lines\59_handwritten_131_c06-058\line_4.jpg	is in a pub where the author throws a
Crop_lines\59_handwritten_131_c06-058\line_5.jpg	10 note on to the bar and orders a
Crop_lines\59_handwritten_131_c06-058\line_6.jpg	round for the pals, one of whom cries:
Crop_lines\60_handwritten_140_c02-012\line_0.jpg	Every unnecessary detail, all superfluous local
Crop_lines\60_handwritten_140_c02-012\line_1.jpg	colouring must be eliminated. He does not
Crop_lines\60_handwritten_140_c02-012\line_2.jpg	want the accuracy of a police photograph,
Crop_lines\60_handwritten_140_c02-012\line_3.jpg	but rather he wants to show the eternal in
Crop_lines\60_handwritten_140_c02-012\line_4.jpg	every instant.” The chilling horror of ”Mala-
Crop_lines\60_handwritten_140_c02-012\line_5.jpg	chias” is due as much to Wicki the photo-
Crop_lines\60_handwritten_140_c02-012\line_6.jpg	grapher as to Wicki the director. His earlier
Crop_lines\60_handwritten_140_c02-012\line_7.jpg	film, ”Die Bru” cke,” was equally terrifying,
Crop_lines\60_handwritten_140_c02-012\line_8.jpg	but here the director moves out of the world
Crop_lines\60_handwritten_140_c02-012\line_9.jpg	of reality into an icy supernatural vacuum
Crop_lines\61_handwritten_146_c02-059\line_0.jpg	Prizes being what they are, Berlin is unusually
Crop_lines\61_handwritten_146_c02-059\line_1.jpg	generous in giving everyone something, and silver
Crop_lines\61_handwritten_146_c02-059\line_2.jpg	bears are awarded in every direction. Both the
Crop_lines\61_handwritten_146_c02-059\line_3.jpg	Antonioni and Wicki films took high honours,
Crop_lines\61_handwritten_146_c02-059\line_4.jpg	and the audience at the awards was particularly
Crop_lines\61_handwritten_146_c02-059\line_5.jpg	enthusiastic when one Miss Anna Kerima was selected
Crop_lines\61_handwritten_146_c02-059\line_6.jpg	as best actress for her work in the Godard
Crop_lines\61_handwritten_146_c02-059\line_7.jpg	film. Gifted with an interesting face, although little
Crop_lines\61_handwritten_146_c02-059\line_8.jpg	acting ability, she would seem to be well
Crop_lines\61_handwritten_146_c02-059\line_9.jpg	worth watching in the months to come.
Crop_lines\62_handwritten_147_c02-078\line_0.jpg	It has a great look of speed and technical fun
Crop_lines\62_handwritten_147_c02-078\line_1.jpg	about it, of enormous cinematic enjoyment, and
Crop_lines\62_handwritten_147_c02-078\line_2.jpg	above all of cinematic sense. Much of it has
Crop_lines\62_handwritten_147_c02-078\line_3.jpg	that air of improvisation, as of off-the-cuff
Crop_lines\62_handwritten_147_c02-078\line_4.jpg	living, that once seemed so new and so
Crop_lines\62_handwritten_147_c02-078\line_5.jpg	attractive. The story (not that the story, in the
Crop_lines\62_handwritten_147_c02-078\line_6.jpg	sense of plot, matters much; but in the sense of
Crop_lines\62_handwritten_147_c02-078\line_7.jpg	situation and movement it matters a lot) is
Crop_lines\62_handwritten_147_c02-078\line_8.jpg	that of a man on the run (Jean-Paul Belmondo),
Crop_lines\62_handwritten_147_c02-078\line_9.jpg	who spends a few days with an American girl
Crop_lines\63_handwritten_150_c03-000a\line_0.jpg	The film version of Miss 3 Shelagh Delaney’s
Crop_lines\63_handwritten_150_c03-000a\line_1.jpg	play A Taste of Honey opens at the Leicester
Crop_lines\63_handwritten_150_c03-000a\line_2.jpg	Square Theatre tomorrow. It has been produced
Crop_lines\63_handwritten_150_c03-000a\line_3.jpg	an directed by Mr. Tony Richardson, who is also
Crop_lines\63_handwritten_150_c03-000a\line_4.jpg	part-author with Miss Delaney of the script,
Crop_lines\63_handwritten_150_c03-000a\line_5.jpg	and the great advantages to be derived from
Crop_lines\63_handwritten_150_c03-000a\line_6.jpg	this unity of conception and control are
Crop_lines\63_handwritten_150_c03-000a\line_7.jpg	everywhere apparent.
Crop_lines\64_handwritten_150_c03-007a\line_0.jpg	In A Taste of Honey Mr. Richardson has
Crop_lines\64_handwritten_150_c03-007a\line_1.jpg	taken a town in the industrial North of England
Crop_lines\64_handwritten_150_c03-007a\line_2.jpg	and has made it live. The shabby streets and
Crop_lines\64_handwritten_150_c03-007a\line_3.jpg	wet pavements, the school play-grounds, the
Crop_lines\64_handwritten_150_c03-007a\line_4.jpg	public monuments and the rubbish strewn canals -
Crop_lines\64_handwritten_150_c03-007a\line_5.jpg	even the worn head-stones in the churchyard,
Crop_lines\64_handwritten_150_c03-007a\line_6.jpg	sacred to the memory of” - are seen as an
Crop_lines\64_handwritten_150_c03-007a\line_7.jpg	integral part of the story.
Crop_lines\65_handwritten_150_c03-081a\line_0.jpg	Arguably, the dramatist has committed a
Crop_lines\65_handwritten_150_c03-081a\line_1.jpg	technical error in allowing Irene to speak
Crop_lines\65_handwritten_150_c03-081a\line_2.jpg	for herself; we would be altogether clearer
Crop_lines\65_handwritten_150_c03-081a\line_3.jpg	in our minds about her if she remained
Crop_lines\65_handwritten_150_c03-081a\line_4.jpg	a flawed but beautiful enigma, seen but not
Crop_lines\65_handwritten_150_c03-081a\line_5.jpg	heard. However, Miss Pinkie Johnstone makes her
Crop_lines\65_handwritten_150_c03-081a\line_6.jpg	few brief scenes effective, and Mr. Dinsdale
Crop_lines\65_handwritten_150_c03-081a\line_7.jpg	Landen, in the longest and most exacting role,
Crop_lines\65_handwritten_150_c03-081a\line_8.jpg	that of the sergeant, gives a performance of
Crop_lines\65_handwritten_150_c03-081a\line_9.jpg	rare intelligence and restrained power.
Crop_lines\66_handwritten_150_c03-084a\line_0.jpg	Mr. Bryan Stonehouse’s production is quietly
Crop_lines\66_handwritten_150_c03-084a\line_1.jpg	effective, giving full value to the formal elements
Crop_lines\66_handwritten_150_c03-084a\line_2.jpg	of Betti’s writing without over-emphasizing
Crop_lines\66_handwritten_150_c03-084a\line_3.jpg	them. Last night’s play in the ”Play of the
Crop_lines\66_handwritten_150_c03-084a\line_4.jpg	Week” series on independent television, Then
Crop_lines\66_handwritten_150_c03-084a\line_5.jpg	We Fall, by Mr. Paul Ferris, was a morality
Crop_lines\66_handwritten_150_c03-084a\line_6.jpg	on the not unfamiliar theme of the destructive
Crop_lines\66_handwritten_150_c03-084a\line_7.jpg	power of unbridled ambition.
Crop_lines\67_handwritten_150_c03-087a\line_0.jpg	It went, perhaps, some distance beyond most
Crop_lines\67_handwritten_150_c03-087a\line_1.jpg	treatments of its subject by attempting to
Crop_lines\67_handwritten_150_c03-087a\line_2.jpg	generate a melodramatic inevitability which
Crop_lines\67_handwritten_150_c03-087a\line_3.jpg	left its central character and the world
Crop_lines\67_handwritten_150_c03-087a\line_4.jpg	around him in complete, unredeemable desolation.
Crop_lines\67_handwritten_150_c03-087a\line_5.jpg	We could, perhaps, say whether or not the attempt
Crop_lines\67_handwritten_150_c03-087a\line_6.jpg	succeeded if we had a little more faith in the
Crop_lines\67_handwritten_150_c03-087a\line_7.jpg	way in which Mr. Ferris manipulated his
Crop_lines\67_handwritten_150_c03-087a\line_8.jpg	characters.
Crop_lines\68_handwritten_150_c03-094a\line_0.jpg	Mr. William Lucas (Morris) is always insensi-
Crop_lines\68_handwritten_150_c03-094a\line_1.jpg	tively pushing, Miss Sheila Allen his wife,
Crop_lines\68_handwritten_150_c03-094a\line_2.jpg	always palely appealing, Mr. James Maxwell,
Crop_lines\68_handwritten_150_c03-094a\line_3.jpg	the editor, always comically abashed by the
Crop_lines\68_handwritten_150_c03-094a\line_4.jpg	events, and Mr. Aubrey Richards, the father-in-
Crop_lines\68_handwritten_150_c03-094a\line_5.jpg	law, always comically grotesque; they were
Crop_lines\68_handwritten_150_c03-094a\line_6.jpg	not asked to modulate from their set moods
Crop_lines\68_handwritten_150_c03-094a\line_7.jpg	but played with proper efficiency and, in
Crop_lines\68_handwritten_150_c03-094a\line_8.jpg	the case of Mr. Richards, with lavish and
Crop_lines\68_handwritten_150_c03-094a\line_9.jpg	suitably gaudy colour.
Crop_lines\69_handwritten_150_c03-096a\line_0.jpg	Only Mr. Lucas’s actions, therefore, arose
Crop_lines\69_handwritten_150_c03-096a\line_1.jpg	explicably from appreciable motives. The rest,
Crop_lines\69_handwritten_150_c03-096a\line_2.jpg	one feels, were driven to effective action by
Crop_lines\69_handwritten_150_c03-096a\line_3.jpg	the author in spite of the ineffectuality
Crop_lines\69_handwritten_150_c03-096a\line_4.jpg	with which he had endowed them. One
Crop_lines\69_handwritten_150_c03-096a\line_5.jpg	hopes that he is not asking us to believe
Crop_lines\69_handwritten_150_c03-096a\line_6.jpg	that ,because of their odd accents, they
Crop_lines\69_handwritten_150_c03-096a\line_7.jpg	act oddly like the queer foreigners of

Crop_lines\70_handwritten_164_c04-122\line_1.jpg	Charles obliged with ” April Serenade.” This week it appears, a
Crop_lines\70_handwritten_164_c04-122\line_2.jpg	tuneful melody sung impeccably by Robert Earl (Philips). PRODUCER
Crop_lines\70_handwritten_164_c04-122\line_3.jpg	Russell Turner, 33, provides his last programme for the B B C tonight
Crop_lines\70_handwritten_164_c04-122\line_4.jpg	with Robert Harbin’s ”Mystery and Magic” (7.30). After six years
Crop_lines\70_handwritten_164_c04-122\line_5.jpg	with the Corporation, during which he started ”Juke Box Jury” and
Crop_lines\70_handwritten_164_c04-122\line_6.jpg	directed ”Six-Five Special,” Turner is aiming to go into free-lance
Crop_lines\70_handwritten_164_c04-122\line_7.jpg	TV, film and stage production work.
Crop_lines\71_handwritten_166_c04-089\line_0.jpg	Now along comes his solo disc, featuring two of his town
Crop_lines\71_handwritten_166_c04-089\line_1.jpg	compositions, ” Deerstalker” and ” Almost Grown Up.” VERDICT:
Crop_lines\71_handwritten_166_c04-089\line_2.jpg	Mr. Lisbon has it taped. And tacked. And he says: ”Just as well
Crop_lines\71_handwritten_166_c04-089\line_3.jpg	I had only one box of tacks - it might have been so
Crop_lines\71_handwritten_166_c04-089\line_4.jpg	different....” More news from the ivory-thumping dept....
Crop_lines\71_handwritten_166_c04-089\line_5.jpg	Russ Conway, who has tinkled his way to fame on an old 2pianna,
Crop_lines\71_handwritten_166_c04-089\line_6.jpg	comes in with another of his own works: ” Parade of the
Crop_lines\71_handwritten_166_c04-089\line_7.jpg	Poppets” (Columbia).
Crop_lines\72_handwritten_166_c04-098\line_0.jpg	But not one of his nimble-fingered best. GERMANY’S Russ
Crop_lines\72_handwritten_166_c04-098\line_1.jpg	Conway is a pianist who calls himself CRAZY OTTO. But
Crop_lines\72_handwritten_166_c04-098\line_2.jpg	nothing crazy about his pianistics. He pounds merrily away
Crop_lines\72_handwritten_166_c04-098\line_3.jpg	at a piece called ” Piccadilly” (Polydor). I find it cute.
Crop_lines\72_handwritten_166_c04-098\line_4.jpg	American pianist Floyd Cramer, who played for Elvis on ”It’s
Crop_lines\72_handwritten_166_c04-098\line_5.jpg	Now or Never,” looks like having a success on his own with
Crop_lines\72_handwritten_166_c04-098\line_6.jpg	”On the Rebound” (RCA).
Crop_lines\73_handwritten_168_c04-110\line_0.jpg	Become a success with a disc and hey presto! You’re a star.... Rolly sings with
Crop_lines\73_handwritten_168_c04-110\line_1.jpg	assuredness ” Bella Bella Marie” (Parlophone), a lively song that changes tempo mid-way.
Crop_lines\73_handwritten_168_c04-110\line_2.jpg	I don’t think he will storm the charts with this one, but it’s a good start.
Crop_lines\73_handwritten_168_c04-110\line_3.jpg	CHRIS CHARLES, 39, who lives in Stockton-on-Tees, is an accountant.
Crop_lines\74_handwritten_168_c04-116\line_0.jpg	He is also a director of a couple of garages. And he finds time as well to be a lyric
Crop_lines\74_handwritten_168_c04-116\line_1.jpg	writer. He writes with Tolchard Evans, composer of ”Lady of Spain” and other big hits.
Crop_lines\74_handwritten_168_c04-116\line_2.jpg	Tolch, as he is known in Tin Pan Alley, likes songs with a month in the title. He wrote
Crop_lines\74_handwritten_168_c04-116\line_3.jpg	”My September Love,” the big David Whitfield hit of 1956.
Crop_lines\75_handwritten_173_c06-011\line_0.jpg	ALSO present is a London journalist who
Crop_lines\75_handwritten_173_c06-011\line_1.jpg	arrived two hours earlier by appointment
Crop_lines\75_handwritten_173_c06-011\line_2.jpg	to talk to the author of Borstal Boy and
Crop_lines\75_handwritten_173_c06-011\line_3.jpg	The Hostage about his new work, if any,
Crop_lines\75_handwritten_173_c06-011\line_4.jpg	and who is now being pluckily convivial
Crop_lines\75_handwritten_173_c06-011\line_5.jpg	to fight off the frustration. The telephone
Crop_lines\75_handwritten_173_c06-011\line_6.jpg	has rung a couple of times, calls from
Crop_lines\75_handwritten_173_c06-011\line_7.jpg	other chums sniffing the wind and
Crop_lines\75_handwritten_173_c06-011\line_8.jpg	offering to drop by for a chat.
Crop_lines\76_handwritten_173_d06-008\line_0.jpg	To ridicule them only pushes them farther
Crop_lines\76_handwritten_173_d06-008\line_1.jpg	into themselves, so that they become
Crop_lines\76_handwritten_173_d06-008\line_2.jpg	unable to speak about it to anybody and
Crop_lines\76_handwritten_173_d06-008\line_3.jpg	the seeds of any amount of trouble are sown,
Crop_lines\76_handwritten_173_d06-008\line_4.jpg	the harvest of which may still be being
Crop_lines\76_handwritten_173_d06-008\line_5.jpg	reaped at forty or fifty. Far better to
Crop_lines\76_handwritten_173_d06-008\line_6.jpg	agree with a child that a particular
Crop_lines\76_handwritten_173_d06-008\line_7.jpg	situation is frightening, and then to face
Crop_lines\76_handwritten_173_d06-008\line_8.jpg	it together until the child can see how
Crop_lines\76_handwritten_173_d06-008\line_9.jpg	unnecessary its fears were.
Crop_lines\77_handwritten_173_d06-020\line_0.jpg	In Gethsemane He prayed that the cup
Crop_lines\77_handwritten_173_d06-020\line_1.jpg	should pass from Him. Jesus shows us
Crop_lines\77_handwritten_173_d06-020\line_2.jpg	the way to face life. To see all the latent
Crop_lines\77_handwritten_173_d06-020\line_3.jpg	frightening possibilities and yet by facing
Crop_lines\77_handwritten_173_d06-020\line_4.jpg	them and knowing God is with us and
Crop_lines\77_handwritten_173_d06-020\line_5.jpg	that, with Him, there is nothing that can
Crop_lines\77_handwritten_173_d06-020\line_6.jpg	finally defeat us. More than that, that God
Crop_lines\77_handwritten_173_d06-020\line_7.jpg	has something important to do with our
Crop_lines\77_handwritten_173_d06-020\line_8.jpg	lives and that the nearer we get to Him,
Crop_lines\77_handwritten_173_d06-020\line_9.jpg	the stronger we become.
Crop_lines\78_handwritten_173_d06-046\line_0.jpg	Even more simply, test your own reactions
Crop_lines\78_handwritten_173_d06-046\line_1.jpg	to different situations. There are some which
Crop_lines\78_handwritten_173_d06-046\line_2.jpg	bring on an almost immediate feeling of
Crop_lines\78_handwritten_173_d06-046\line_3.jpg	tiredness - such as when your wife mentions
Crop_lines\78_handwritten_173_d06-046\line_4.jpg	the washing-up - while others, if they
Crop_lines\78_handwritten_173_d06-046\line_5.jpg	refer to something you like doing, bring a
Crop_lines\78_handwritten_173_d06-046\line_6.jpg	veritable surge of energy. Many a girl who
Crop_lines\78_handwritten_173_d06-046\line_7.jpg	is ’too tired to help mum’ will later jump
Crop_lines\78_handwritten_173_d06-046\line_8.jpg	up with no apparent tiredness at all when
Crop_lines\78_handwritten_173_d06-046\line_9.jpg	her boy friend calls and go for a long walk.
Crop_lines\79_handwritten_184_d04-005\line_0.jpg	According to the legend, Solomon had asked the
Crop_lines\79_handwritten_184_d04-005\line_1.jpg	Prince of the Demons, ” Ashmodeus” to bring him
Crop_lines\79_handwritten_184_d04-005\line_2.jpg	the Shamir and Ashmodeus told him that the
Crop_lines\79_handwritten_184_d04-005\line_3.jpg	Shamir had not been placed under his charge, as
Crop_lines\79_handwritten_184_d04-005\line_4.jpg	there is no Shamir in Gehenna (Hell). An eagle
Crop_lines\79_handwritten_184_d04-005\line_5.jpg	brought the Shamir to Solomon from Eden,
Crop_lines\79_handwritten_184_d04-005\line_6.jpg	the Paradise, the only place where the Shamir
Crop_lines\79_handwritten_184_d04-005\line_7.jpg	could be found.
Crop_lines\80_handwritten_188_d04-053\line_0.jpg	Freedom from want cannot be fulfilled nor
Crop_lines\80_handwritten_188_d04-053\line_1.jpg	freedom from fear, fear of starvation in the
Crop_lines\80_handwritten_188_d04-053\line_2.jpg	midst of plenty. Help will not be easily forth-
Crop_lines\80_handwritten_188_d04-053\line_3.jpg	coming for the people in need. They will
Crop_lines\80_handwritten_188_d04-053\line_4.jpg	think of the animals first (which is of course
Crop_lines\80_handwritten_188_d04-053\line_5.jpg	our duty). Of course the individual will
Crop_lines\80_handwritten_188_d04-053\line_6.jpg	eat and be full but: ”Take heed to yourself,
Crop_lines\80_handwritten_188_d04-053\line_7.jpg	that your heart be not deceived, and lye turn
Crop_lines\80_handwritten_188_d04-053\line_8.jpg	aside, and serve other gods, and worship them”,
Crop_lines\80_handwritten_188_d04-053\line_9.jpg	the yourself is thy greatest enemy, the self-
Crop_lines\80_handwritten_188_d04-053\line_10.jpg	seeking self.
Crop_lines\81_handwritten_191_d04-066\line_0.jpg	And the sequence in the text is different than
Crop_lines\81_handwritten_191_d04-066\line_1.jpg	in the first part of the Shmah, we have first ”and
Crop_lines\81_handwritten_191_d04-066\line_2.jpg	to bind them for a sign upon your hand, that
Crop_lines\81_handwritten_191_d04-066\line_3.jpg	they may be as frontlets between your eyes.” First to
Crop_lines\81_handwritten_191_d04-066\line_4.jpg	bind them to have the vision and then ” And lye
Crop_lines\81_handwritten_191_d04-066\line_5.jpg	shall teach them to your children.” And as we have go-
Crop_lines\81_handwritten_191_d04-066\line_6.jpg	ne through the mill, we need not teach them
Crop_lines\81_handwritten_191_d04-066\line_7.jpg	to the children any more diligently and the
Crop_lines\81_handwritten_191_d04-066\line_8.jpg	children will grasp now what will befall
Crop_lines\81_handwritten_191_d04-066\line_9.jpg	them without visionary power.
Crop_lines\82_handwritten_202_d06-000\line_0.jpg	In the first place it is not a great deal
Crop_lines\82_handwritten_202_d06-000\line_1.jpg	of use telling even children, as I have
Crop_lines\82_handwritten_202_d06-000\line_2.jpg	already suggested, not to be silly or
Crop_lines\82_handwritten_202_d06-000\line_3.jpg	to pull themselves together. Far better
Crop_lines\82_handwritten_202_d06-000\line_4.jpg	to help them to face whatever it is that
Crop_lines\82_handwritten_202_d06-000\line_5.jpg	is worrying them, to find the original
Crop_lines\82_handwritten_202_d06-000\line_6.jpg	cause and then deal with it; show it
Crop_lines\82_handwritten_202_d06-000\line_7.jpg	up either for the sham it is - and many
Crop_lines\82_handwritten_202_d06-000\line_8.jpg	fears are based upon completely
Crop_lines\82_handwritten_202_d06-000\line_9.jpg	irrational pre-conceived notions - or to
Crop_lines\83_handwritten_202_d06-091\line_0.jpg	There may be some who will argue that
Crop_lines\83_handwritten_202_d06-091\line_1.jpg	routine destroys the soul. It is so easy,
Crop_lines\83_handwritten_202_d06-091\line_2.jpg	they say, to get into a rut. Save us
Crop_lines\83_handwritten_202_d06-091\line_3.jpg	from the school curriculum and even
Crop_lines\83_handwritten_202_d06-091\line_4.jpg	worse the school system whereby for
Crop_lines\83_handwritten_202_d06-091\line_5.jpg	meals everybody knows beforehand
Crop_lines\83_handwritten_202_d06-091\line_6.jpg	exactly what, on any given day of the
Crop_lines\83_handwritten_202_d06-091\line_7.jpg	week, they are going to have. If - such
Crop_lines\83_handwritten_202_d06-091\line_8.jpg	a critic may say - you are calling
Crop_lines\83_handwritten_202_d06-091\line_9.jpg	us to adventure, do not strangle us before
Crop_lines\83_handwritten_202_d06-091\line_10.jpg	we start by putting us into a strait-jacket
Crop_lines\84_handwritten_202_e06-006\line_0.jpg	The effect of bottom congestion due to
Crop_lines\84_handwritten_202_e06-006\line_1.jpg	the light pressure is inevitably mixed
Crop_lines\84_handwritten_202_e06-006\line_2.jpg	with that of the suitability of ground
Crop_lines\84_handwritten_202_e06-006\line_3.jpg	for spawning. Both result in crowding,
Crop_lines\84_handwritten_202_e06-006\line_4.jpg	so there is no need to try to separate
Crop_lines\84_handwritten_202_e06-006\line_5.jpg	them - thank Heaven! A good picture of
Crop_lines\84_handwritten_202_e06-006\line_6.jpg	this is seen on the 150 miles of spawning
Crop_lines\84_handwritten_202_e06-006\line_7.jpg	grounds from the Viking in the north down
Crop_lines\84_handwritten_202_e06-006\line_8.jpg	to the Klondykes and the Reef along
Crop_lines\84_handwritten_202_e06-006\line_9.jpg	the western edge of the Norwegian
Crop_lines\84_handwritten_202_e06-006\line_10.jpg	Deep.
Crop_lines\85_handwritten_210_e01-014\line_0.jpg	We know from the diaries of Samuel Pepys
Crop_lines\85_handwritten_210_e01-014\line_1.jpg	that he was a great man for lace - paying
Crop_lines\85_handwritten_210_e01-014\line_2.jpg	as much as 3 for a lace collar. But this
Crop_lines\85_handwritten_210_e01-014\line_3.jpg	didn’t mean he was prepared to do as much
Crop_lines\85_handwritten_210_e01-014\line_4.jpg	for his lady, for he records testily: "My wife
Crop_lines\85_handwritten_210_e01-014\line_5.jpg	and I fell out about my not being willing
Crop_lines\85_handwritten_210_e01-014\line_6.jpg	to have her gown laced.’
Crop_lines\86_handwritten_210_e01-018\line_0.jpg	We read, with sympathy, an advertisement in the
Crop_lines\86_handwritten_210_e01-018\line_1.jpg	reign of Charles 2 stating: *Lost: a lawn lhand=
Crop_lines\86_handwritten_210_e01-018\line_2.jpg	kercher with a broad hem laced round with
Crop_lines\86_handwritten_210_e01-018\line_3.jpg	fine Point lace about four fingers broad’ and
Crop_lines\86_handwritten_210_e01-018\line_4.jpg	among the effects left by Nell Gwyn is an
Crop_lines\86_handwritten_210_e01-018\line_5.jpg	unpaid bill for ’scarlet satin shoes with
Crop_lines\86_handwritten_210_e01-018\line_6.jpg	silver lace’. The records of these tender trifles
Crop_lines\86_handwritten_210_e01-018\line_7.jpg	are very touching but then lace does place
Crop_lines\86_handwritten_210_e01-018\line_8.jpg	upon everything a delicate sentiment.
Crop_lines\87_handwritten_225_e02-086\line_0.jpg	Coming now to the actual tools and their cost, we begin
Crop_lines\87_handwritten_225_e02-086\line_1.jpg	with what we have called a bare minimum kit. Probably
Crop_lines\87_handwritten_225_e02-086\line_2.jpg	most men have some of the tools already. It will enable
Crop_lines\87_handwritten_225_e02-086\line_3.jpg	a man to make simple, straight-forward things, and in
Crop_lines\87_handwritten_225_e02-086\line_4.jpg	any case may be regarded as a good beginning to
Crop_lines\87_handwritten_225_e02-086\line_5.jpg	which other tools can be added as the need arises. The
Crop_lines\87_handwritten_225_e02-086\line_6.jpg	nature of the work will probably dictate the additions
Crop_lines\87_handwritten_225_e02-086\line_7.jpg	to be made, but as a guide we have given a fuller kit
Crop_lines\87_handwritten_225_e02-086\line_8.jpg	which increases the range of things that can be
Crop_lines\87_handwritten_225_e02-086\line_9.jpg	made enormously.
Crop_lines\88_handwritten_228_e02-100\line_0.jpg	Most tools have to lead an intensive life, and faults
Crop_lines\88_handwritten_228_e02-100\line_1.jpg	in design or quality soon become apparent. It is far
Crop_lines\88_handwritten_228_e02-100\line_2.jpg	better to pay the fair price for a tool of good
Crop_lines\88_handwritten_228_e02-100\line_3.jpg	quality, and not handicap yourself from the start.
Crop_lines\88_handwritten_228_e02-100\line_4.jpg	To put it in a slightly different way, do not allow
Crop_lines\88_handwritten_228_e02-100\line_5.jpg	yourself to blame the tools when the job does
Crop_lines\88_handwritten_228_e02-100\line_6.jpg	not turn out quite right!
Crop_lines\89_handwritten_248_e07-105\line_0.jpg	Many amateur gardeners might improve their
Crop_lines\89_handwritten_248_e07-105\line_1.jpg	results by buying a small hand-operated soil
Crop_lines\89_handwritten_248_e07-105\line_2.jpg	block maker and use the money saved on
Crop_lines\89_handwritten_248_e07-105\line_3.jpg	buying small pots to improve their composts.
Crop_lines\89_handwritten_248_e07-105\line_4.jpg	The various types of small paper pots are very
Crop_lines\89_handwritten_248_e07-105\line_5.jpg	useful for short-term operations, but are
Crop_lines\89_handwritten_248_e07-105\line_6.jpg	inclined to collapse if the plants are in them
Crop_lines\89_handwritten_248_e07-105\line_7.jpg	too long.
Crop_lines\90_handwritten_268_f03-174\line_0.jpg	So - see the next page! Yes, they are waiting for you.
Crop_lines\90_handwritten_268_f03-174\line_1.jpg	But there is no need to be frightened. The audience
Crop_lines\90_handwritten_268_f03-174\line_2.jpg	will eat out of your hand - if they like what
Crop_lines\90_handwritten_268_f03-174\line_3.jpg	you offer them. A good start will put them in a
Crop_lines\90_handwritten_268_f03-174\line_4.jpg	good humour. Ladies and gentlemen! I’m afraid
Crop_lines\90_handwritten_268_f03-174\line_5.jpg	I have not had much experience of public speaking.
Crop_lines\91_handwritten_278_f04-046\line_0.jpg	Even the bone cuff-links found beside the body, which
Crop_lines\91_handwritten_278_f04-046\line_1.jpg	had at first been considered as belonging to the killer,
Crop_lines\91_handwritten_278_f04-046\line_2.jpg	proved yet another red herring, for it was learned that
Crop_lines\91_handwritten_278_f04-046\line_3.jpg	they had been borrowed by Elizabeth Camp from one
Crop_lines\91_handwritten_278_f04-046\line_4.jpg	of her sisters. A young man from Reading named Marshall
Crop_lines\91_handwritten_278_f04-046\line_5.jpg	had an uncomfortable time in the presence of the coroner.
Crop_lines\92_handwritten_283_f04-083\line_0.jpg	So the body of this small girl with the blue eyes and
Crop_lines\92_handwritten_283_f04-083\line_1.jpg	long brown hair in a bun at the back of her head
Crop_lines\92_handwritten_283_f04-083\line_2.jpg	remained a mystery until later the following day.
Crop_lines\92_handwritten_283_f04-083\line_3.jpg	During that time a description of the girl was
Crop_lines\92_handwritten_283_f04-083\line_4.jpg	circulated, and a Mr Robert Money came forward to
Crop_lines\92_handwritten_283_f04-083\line_5.jpg	identify her as his sister, Mary Money, aged twenty-two.
Crop_lines\92_handwritten_283_f04-083\line_6.jpg	The girl, who was described as being always bright and
Crop_lines\92_handwritten_283_f04-083\line_7.jpg	jolly,” had been unmarried, and lived at Lavender Hill,
Crop_lines\92_handwritten_283_f04-083\line_8.jpg	Clapham, on the premises of a dairyman, Bridger, for
Crop_lines\92_handwritten_283_f04-083\line_9.jpg	whom she worked as a bookkeeper.
Crop_lines\93_handwritten_283_f04-087\line_0.jpg	On the Sunday, the day of her death, she had gone out in the
Crop_lines\93_handwritten_283_f04-087\line_1.jpg	evening at about seven o’clock, telling her room-mate, Emma
Crop_lines\93_handwritten_283_f04-087\line_2.jpg	Hone, that she was going for a walk, but would not be
Crop_lines\93_handwritten_283_f04-087\line_3.jpg	gone for long. According to Miss Hone, she had not been
Crop_lines\93_handwritten_283_f04-087\line_4.jpg	carrying a handbag, but she believed she had had a small
Crop_lines\93_handwritten_283_f04-087\line_5.jpg	purse.
Crop_lines\94_handwritten_288_f07-019a\line_0.jpg	Epicures and gourmands, sated by the unending
Crop_lines\94_handwritten_288_f07-019a\line_1.jpg	procession of dishes from those mammoth kitchens
Crop_lines\94_handwritten_288_f07-019a\line_2.jpg	of the 18th century - that amazing epoch of
Crop_lines\94_handwritten_288_f07-019a\line_3.jpg	grossness and delicacy - sought inspiration at last from
Crop_lines\94_handwritten_288_f07-019a\line_4.jpg	the dishes of the country, and, instead of gorging the
Crop_lines\94_handwritten_288_f07-019a\line_5.jpg	eye with magnitude, began to understand the value of
Crop_lines\94_handwritten_288_f07-019a\line_6.jpg	intelligent selection and comparative simplicity, though
Crop_lines\94_handwritten_288_f07-019a\line_7.jpg	nowadays their simplified meals would seem quite
Crop_lines\94_handwritten_288_f07-019a\line_8.jpg	monstrous.
Crop_lines\95_handwritten_288_f07-028a\line_0.jpg	When, however, the Greeks did learn the art of making
Crop_lines\95_handwritten_288_f07-028a\line_1.jpg	fireproof earthenware from the Egyptians, their cookery
Crop_lines\95_handwritten_288_f07-028a\line_2.jpg	made rapid progress, because they were men of taste
Crop_lines\95_handwritten_288_f07-028a\line_3.jpg	and intellect. A remarkable peculiarity in the banquets
Crop_lines\95_handwritten_288_f07-028a\line_4.jpg	of the ancient world was the fact that they did not
Crop_lines\95_handwritten_288_f07-028a\line_5.jpg	confine the resources of the table to the gratification
Crop_lines\95_handwritten_288_f07-028a\line_6.jpg	of one sense alone. Having exhausted their invention
Crop_lines\95_handwritten_288_f07-028a\line_7.jpg	in the preparation of stimulants for the palate,
Crop_lines\95_handwritten_288_f07-028a\line_8.jpg	they broke fresh ground and called another sense
Crop_lines\95_handwritten_288_f07-028a\line_9.jpg	to their aid.
Crop_lines\96_handwritten_288_f07-032a\line_0.jpg	By delicate application of odours and richly-distilled
Crop_lines\96_handwritten_288_f07-032a\line_1.jpg	perfumes, these refined voluptuaies aroused the
Crop_lines\96_handwritten_288_f07-032a\line_2.jpg	fainting appetite and added a more exquisite and
Crop_lines\96_handwritten_288_f07-032a\line_3.jpg	ethereal enjoyment to the grosser pleasures of the
Crop_lines\96_handwritten_288_f07-032a\line_4.jpg	board. The gratification of the sense of smelling
Crop_lines\96_handwritten_288_f07-032a\line_5.jpg	was a subject of no little importance to the Romans.
Crop_lines\96_handwritten_288_f07-032a\line_6.jpg	They considered flowers as forming a very essential
Crop_lines\96_handwritten_288_f07-032a\line_7.jpg	article in their festal preparations; and it is the
Crop_lines\96_handwritten_288_f07-032a\line_8.jpg	opinion of Bassius that at their desserts the
Crop_lines\96_handwritten_288_f07-032a\line_9.jpg	number of flowers far exceeded the number
Crop_lines\96_handwritten_288_f07-032a\line_10.jpg	of fruits.
Crop_lines\97_handwritten_292_f07-076a\line_0.jpg	The Czechoslovak kitchen, again, is
Crop_lines\97_handwritten_292_f07-076a\line_1.jpg	so languorous, so passionate, and
Crop_lines\97_handwritten_292_f07-076a\line_2.jpg	possibly comparable alone to a gypsy
Crop_lines\97_handwritten_292_f07-076a\line_3.jpg	melody. The paprika and caraway perfume
Crop_lines\97_handwritten_292_f07-076a\line_4.jpg	the meats with their antithesis. The
Crop_lines\97_handwritten_292_f07-076a\line_5.jpg	opulent varieties of Czechoslovak past-
Crop_lines\97_handwritten_292_f07-076a\line_6.jpg	ries recall in fact the rich heritage
Crop_lines\97_handwritten_292_f07-076a\line_7.jpg	of rich embroideries and costumes
Crop_lines\97_handwritten_292_f07-076a\line_8.jpg	specifically national. The art and
Crop_lines\97_handwritten_292_f07-076a\line_9.jpg	science of cookery, however, is
Crop_lines\97_handwritten_292_f07-076a\line_10.jpg	essentially French, and, irrespective of
Crop_lines\98_handwritten_292_f07-081a\line_0.jpg	The French have an inborn appreciation
Crop_lines\98_handwritten_292_f07-081a\line_1.jpg	of good food and the gusto which they
Crop_lines\98_handwritten_292_f07-081a\line_2.jpg	derive from gastronomy is intellectual
Crop_lines\98_handwritten_292_f07-081a\line_3.jpg	and aesthetic as well as physical.
Crop_lines\98_handwritten_292_f07-081a\line_4.jpg	There is the same finesse about their
Crop_lines\98_handwritten_292_f07-081a\line_5.jpg	feeding, the same subtle delicacy of
Crop_lines\98_handwritten_292_f07-081a\line_6.jpg	touch, the same unfailing sense of
Crop_lines\98_handwritten_292_f07-081a\line_7.jpg	proportion as exists among her
Crop_lines\98_handwritten_292_f07-081a\line_8.jpg	writers, music composers and other
Crop_lines\98_handwritten_292_f07-081a\line_9.jpg	exponents of things that are
Crop_lines\98_handwritten_292_f07-081a\line_10.jpg	typically French.
Crop_lines\99_handwritten_292_f07-084a\line_0.jpg	The ”pot-au-feu” is as much a national
Crop_lines\99_handwritten_292_f07-084a\line_1.jpg	institution in France as is tea drinking
Crop_lines\99_handwritten_292_f07-084a\line_2.jpg	among ourselves and it is prepared at
Crop_lines\99_handwritten_292_f07-084a\line_3.jpg	least once a week in every bourgeois
Crop_lines\99_handwritten_292_f07-084a\line_4.jpg	household. Thackeray, of course,
Crop_lines\99_handwritten_292_f07-084a\line_5.jpg	waxed enthusiastic about Bouilla-
Crop_lines\99_handwritten_292_f07-084a\line_6.jpg	baisse and sang - This Bouillabaisse
Crop_lines\99_handwritten_292_f07-084a\line_7.jpg	a noble dish is, A sort of soup, or

Crop_lines\104_handwritten_297_g01-022\line_8.jpg	DESPISED THEM. THE COMMONS WERE
Crop_lines\104_handwritten_297_g01-022\line_9.jpg	GLAD ENOUGH TO ENJOY THE FRUITS
Crop_lines\105_handwritten_297_g01-027\line_0.jpg	In appreciating this story, modern con-
Crop_lines\105_handwritten_297_g01-027\line_1.jpg	ceptions of governmental duties must be
Crop_lines\105_handwritten_297_g01-027\line_2.jpg	set aside. A modern government needs
Crop_lines\105_handwritten_297_g01-027\line_3.jpg	taxation not merely for defence and
Crop_lines\105_handwritten_297_g01-027\line_4.jpg	offence but for a very wide range of
Crop_lines\105_handwritten_297_g01-027\line_5.jpg	social services. A mediaeval oligarchy
Crop_lines\105_handwritten_297_g01-027\line_6.jpg	needed taxation in order to supplement
Crop_lines\105_handwritten_297_g01-027\line_7.jpg	the private wealth of the monarchy
Crop_lines\105_handwritten_297_g01-027\line_8.jpg	(the royal income from the revenues of
Crop_lines\105_handwritten_297_g01-027\line_9.jpg	crown lands, the fees of feudalism
Crop_lines\106_handwritten_298_g01-031\line_0.jpg	Social service as a function of government
Crop_lines\106_handwritten_298_g01-031\line_1.jpg	was quite alien to mediaeval thought - its
Crop_lines\106_handwritten_298_g01-031\line_2.jpg	substitute was the mutual self-help of
Crop_lines\106_handwritten_298_g01-031\line_3.jpg	communities, whether those communities were
Crop_lines\106_handwritten_298_g01-031\line_4.jpg	monasteries, manors, townships, or wards and
Crop_lines\106_handwritten_298_g01-031\line_5.jpg	guilds of a city. A mediaeval tax was
Crop_lines\106_handwritten_298_g01-031\line_6.jpg	therefore in essence a forced payment whose
Crop_lines\106_handwritten_298_g01-031\line_7.jpg	return was the uncertain bounty of booty
Crop_lines\106_handwritten_298_g01-031\line_8.jpg	and the vague advantages of military glory;
Crop_lines\106_handwritten_298_g01-031\line_9.jpg	it was therefore always granted grudgingly
Crop_lines\106_handwritten_298_g01-031\line_10.jpg	and coupled with the vain hope that, in the
Crop_lines\107_handwritten_298_g01-034\line_0.jpg	When ’his’ war did not bring victory and
Crop_lines\107_handwritten_298_g01-034\line_1.jpg	booty, a new group of Lords might oust
Crop_lines\107_handwritten_298_g01-034\line_2.jpg	the unsuccessful leaders, and the Commons,
Crop_lines\107_handwritten_298_g01-034\line_3.jpg	who usually supplied the hard cash, might
Crop_lines\107_handwritten_298_g01-034\line_4.jpg	be bold enough to demand the production of
Crop_lines\107_handwritten_298_g01-034\line_5.jpg	accounts, and even at times the impeachment of
Crop_lines\107_handwritten_298_g01-034\line_6.jpg	the unsuccessful. But the Commons were not
Crop_lines\107_handwritten_298_g01-034\line_7.jpg	the people, and even a full Parliament was
Crop_lines\107_handwritten_298_g01-034\line_8.jpg	not yet a true mirror of the nation.
Crop_lines\108_handwritten_298_g01-037\line_0.jpg	The people - Langland’s ’folk’ and Gaunt’s
Crop_lines\108_handwritten_298_g01-037\line_1.jpg	’knaves’ - were villeins still tied to the
Crop_lines\108_handwritten_298_g01-037\line_2.jpg	feudal obligations of work or villeins who
Crop_lines\108_handwritten_298_g01-037\line_3.jpg	had bought their release, free labourers
Crop_lines\108_handwritten_298_g01-037\line_4.jpg	who worked for the highest bidders, free
Crop_lines\108_handwritten_298_g01-037\line_5.jpg	yeomen who had prospered enough to become
Crop_lines\108_handwritten_298_g01-037\line_6.jpg	successful farmers, the artisans, craftsmen,
Crop_lines\108_handwritten_298_g01-037\line_7.jpg	journeymen and small tradesmen of the
Crop_lines\108_handwritten_298_g01-037\line_8.jpg	towns, and the retainers and men-at-arms
Crop_lines\108_handwritten_298_g01-037\line_9.jpg	in the pay of landed Lords.
Crop_lines\109_handwritten_304_g02-062\line_0.jpg	At one and the same time, therefore, occur the beat
Crop_lines\109_handwritten_304_g02-062\line_1.jpg	of the apex, the thickening of the heart walls, and
Crop_lines\109_handwritten_304_g02-062\line_2.jpg	the forcible expulsion of their contained blood by the
Crop_lines\109_handwritten_304_g02-062\line_3.jpg	contraction of the ventricles. Going on in Chapter Three
Crop_lines\109_handwritten_304_g02-062\line_4.jpg	to the movement of the arteries, likewise gauged from
Crop_lines\109_handwritten_304_g02-062\line_5.jpg	the dissections of living animals, Harvey noted that
Crop_lines\109_handwritten_304_g02-062\line_6.jpg	contraction of the heart and the apex beat occur in
Crop_lines\109_handwritten_304_g02-062\line_7.jpg	systole, simultaneously with dilatation of the arteries
Crop_lines\109_handwritten_304_g02-062\line_8.jpg	and of the artery-like vein, and expulsion of the
Crop_lines\109_handwritten_304_g02-062\line_9.jpg	ventricular content.
Crop_lines\110_handwritten_320_g04-039\line_0.jpg	My eldest brother was then living in Limpsfield with
Crop_lines\110_handwritten_320_g04-039\line_1.jpg	his family, and found a very suitable house nearby
Crop_lines\110_handwritten_320_g04-039\line_2.jpg	where my mother settled, and eventually died in 1926
Crop_lines\110_handwritten_320_g04-039\line_3.jpg	at the age of 92. Dr. Burge was not able to be present
Crop_lines\110_handwritten_320_g04-039\line_4.jpg	at the Institution and Induction Service in St. Mark’s.
Crop_lines\110_handwritten_320_g04-039\line_5.jpg	This was taken by the Suffragan Bishop of Woolwich,
Crop_lines\110_handwritten_320_g04-039\line_6.jpg	Dr. John Leake, who lived at Blackheath, and was
Crop_lines\110_handwritten_320_g04-039\line_7.jpg	a close friend of ours.
Crop_lines\111_handwritten_321_g04-043\line_0.jpg	But what a change from the dear little old church
Crop_lines\111_handwritten_321_g04-043\line_1.jpg	at Tatsfield to the great modern church of St. Mark’s
Crop_lines\111_handwritten_321_g04-043\line_2.jpg	at Purley. One felt at Tatsfield that, small as the
Crop_lines\111_handwritten_321_g04-043\line_3.jpg	church was, it had its own atmosphere, and for centuries
Crop_lines\111_handwritten_321_g04-043\line_4.jpg	had been a House of Prayer. I could not but feel the
Crop_lines\111_handwritten_321_g04-043\line_5.jpg	chilliness of the new church, beautiful as it was and is.
Crop_lines\111_handwritten_321_g04-043\line_6.jpg	When we had found a group of people who gladly
Crop_lines\111_handwritten_321_g04-043\line_7.jpg	co-operated, we made the little side chapel a place
Crop_lines\111_handwritten_321_g04-043\line_8.jpg	of daily prayer.
Crop_lines\112_handwritten_321_g04-048\line_0.jpg	I suggested to the congregation that it needed
Crop_lines\112_handwritten_321_g04-048\line_1.jpg	warming up by constant prayer and worship, and we
Crop_lines\112_handwritten_321_g04-048\line_2.jpg	found many to help. Gifts of candlesticks and
Crop_lines\112_handwritten_321_g04-048\line_3.jpg	stained-glass lancet windows - finally a new altar -
Crop_lines\112_handwritten_321_g04-048\line_4.jpg	helped to furnish the chapel as a little sanctuary
Crop_lines\112_handwritten_321_g04-048\line_5.jpg	for prayer and quiet. In time we received similar
Crop_lines\112_handwritten_321_g04-048\line_6.jpg	gifts for the High Altar, and large East and West
Crop_lines\112_handwritten_321_g04-048\line_7.jpg	windows.
Crop_lines\113_handwritten_324_g04-060\line_0.jpg	The Church Army Captain had done very good work in the
Crop_lines\113_handwritten_324_g04-060\line_1.jpg	Lansdowne Road district, but I needed more help in the
Crop_lines\113_handwritten_324_g04-060\line_2.jpg	church for the full rota of services on Sundays and weekdays.
Crop_lines\113_handwritten_324_g04-060\line_3.jpg	Most fortunately I was able to engage the Rev. E. U. Evitt in
Crop_lines\113_handwritten_324_g04-060\line_4.jpg	1913 soon after I had come, and he organized the Mission
Crop_lines\113_handwritten_324_g04-060\line_5.jpg	district and got to know, and be known by, many of
Crop_lines\113_handwritten_324_g04-060\line_6.jpg	the people of the parish.
Crop_lines\114_handwritten_324_g04-063\line_0.jpg	A great blow disturbed all our efforts in the following

Crop_lines\114_handwritten_324_g04-063\line_2.jpg	the Forces were urgently needed, and I felt clearly
Crop_lines\114_handwritten_324_g04-063\line_3.jpg	that one of us must volunteer. The Bishop, Dr. Burge, did
Crop_lines\114_handwritten_324_g04-063\line_4.jpg	not wish me to go then, as I had barely been in the parish
Crop_lines\114_handwritten_324_g04-063\line_5.jpg	for a year. Mr. Evitt, however, was much less committed
Crop_lines\114_handwritten_324_g04-063\line_6.jpg	than his Vicar, and he was accepted at once and
Crop_lines\114_handwritten_324_g04-063\line_7.jpg	was very soon in France where he did splendid
Crop_lines\114_handwritten_324_g04-063\line_8.jpg	work until his health broke down and he had a bad
Crop_lines\114_handwritten_324_g04-063\line_9.jpg	attack of enteric fever.
Crop_lines\115_handwritten_340_g06-047i\line_0.jpg	This remarkable man of medicine, whom Sir Francis
Crop_lines\115_handwritten_340_g06-047i\line_1.jpg	Burdett described to Anglesey a year or two later as
Crop_lines\115_handwritten_340_g06-047i\line_2.jpg	’more like a God upon earth than a human being’, had
Crop_lines\115_handwritten_340_g06-047i\line_3.jpg	an increasing number of disciples among unorthodox
Crop_lines\115_handwritten_340_g06-047i\line_4.jpg	medical men in the cities of Europe. One of these
Crop_lines\115_handwritten_340_g06-047i\line_5.jpg	was the Neapolitan, Dr Giuseppe Mauro, whom
Crop_lines\115_handwritten_340_g06-047i\line_6.jpg	Anglesey consulted in May 1834.
Crop_lines\116_handwritten_340_g06-050i\line_0.jpg	Mauro’s first action was to write to his revered master
Crop_lines\116_handwritten_340_g06-050i\line_1.jpg	at Ko” then, near Leipzig, asking for advice. In doing so
Crop_lines\116_handwritten_340_g06-050i\line_2.jpg	he described his distinguished patient and his symptoms.
Crop_lines\116_handwritten_340_g06-050i\line_3.jpg	He told Hahnemann that he found Anglesey a strong,
Crop_lines\116_handwritten_340_g06-050i\line_4.jpg	energetic man with a gentle and charming character,
Crop_lines\116_handwritten_340_g06-050i\line_5.jpg	even-tempered and sedate, not easily irritated, patient
Crop_lines\116_handwritten_340_g06-050i\line_6.jpg	and persevering, ’but he appears to despair of ever being
Crop_lines\116_handwritten_340_g06-050i\line_7.jpg	cured.’
Crop_lines\117_handwritten_347_g06-011p\line_0.jpg	By the end of the month he still delighted in Naples. He
Crop_lines\117_handwritten_347_g06-011p\line_1.jpg	told Cloncurry that he enjoyed it as much as his health
Crop_lines\117_handwritten_347_g06-011p\line_2.jpg	permitted him to enjoy anything. ’The Pearl’, he wrote,
Crop_lines\117_handwritten_347_g06-011p\line_3.jpg	’is arrived, which is a great resource. Vesuvius seems
Crop_lines\117_handwritten_347_g06-011p\line_4.jpg	to be tired; he is going out fast.... What a gay, lively
Crop_lines\117_handwritten_347_g06-011p\line_5.jpg	people, and what a busy town. At Rome, every other
Crop_lines\117_handwritten_347_g06-011p\line_6.jpg	man was a priest: here the priest is lsuperceded by
Crop_lines\117_handwritten_347_g06-011p\line_7.jpg	the soldier - a favourable change in my eye,
Crop_lines\117_handwritten_347_g06-011p\line_8.jpg	particularly as the troops are very fine.’
Crop_lines\118_handwritten_347_g06-018p\line_0.jpg	When the sailing season was past, he sent Pearl back to
Crop_lines\118_handwritten_347_g06-018p\line_1.jpg	England, and returned to Rome for the winter. In
Crop_lines\118_handwritten_347_g06-018p\line_2.jpg	late November, he was ’suffering as usual’, but hoped,
Crop_lines\118_handwritten_347_g06-018p\line_3.jpg	he told Arthur, ’to find this place agree with me
Crop_lines\118_handwritten_347_g06-018p\line_4.jpg	better than Naples. The journey has been against me,
Crop_lines\118_handwritten_347_g06-018p\line_5.jpg	as there has been much rain and damp, but the
Crop_lines\118_handwritten_347_g06-018p\line_6.jpg	temperature is high & I have not yet thought of a
Crop_lines\118_handwritten_347_g06-018p\line_7.jpg	fire...
Crop_lines\119_handwritten_347_g06-026p\line_0.jpg	A pleasant life truly!... It so happens that I have an

Crop_lines\119_handwritten_347_g06-026p\line_2.jpg	that ever was. But he has not one word of English.’
Crop_lines\119_handwritten_347_g06-026p\line_3.jpg	While he was writing this letter he heard of the fall
Crop_lines\119_handwritten_347_g06-026p\line_4.jpg	of the Whigs, and the temporary assumption of the
Crop_lines\119_handwritten_347_g06-026p\line_5.jpg	government by the Duke of Wellington.

Crop_lines\121_handwritten_347_g06-037p\line_3.jpg	While he was in Naples there had opened a new chapter
Crop_lines\121_handwritten_347_g06-037p\line_4.jpg	in the history of Anglesey’s unceasing search for an
Crop_lines\121_handwritten_347_g06-037p\line_5.jpg	effective alleviation of his painful malady. None of the
Crop_lines\121_handwritten_347_g06-037p\line_6.jpg	numerous conventional remedies to which he had been
Crop_lines\121_handwritten_347_g06-037p\line_7.jpg	subjected ever since the symptoms had first shown

Crop_lines\121_handwritten_347_g06-037p\line_9.jpg	slightest effect.
Crop_lines\122_handwritten_347_g06-042p\line_0.jpg	Nor is this to be wondered at, for even today, in the
Crop_lines\122_handwritten_347_g06-042p\line_1.jpg	1960s, no cure has been found for the 6tic douloureux.
Crop_lines\122_handwritten_347_g06-042p\line_2.jpg	As early as 1830, when Anglesey believed himself to
Crop_lines\122_handwritten_347_g06-042p\line_3.jpg	be on the point of death, the new German curative
Crop_lines\122_handwritten_347_g06-042p\line_4.jpg	method known as homoeopathy had been brought
Crop_lines\122_handwritten_347_g06-042p\line_5.jpg	to his notice.
Crop_lines\123_handwritten_347_g06-045p\line_0.jpg	In April of that year his first wife’s brother-in-law, the diplomatist
Crop_lines\123_handwritten_347_g06-045p\line_1.jpg	Lord Ponsonby, had written to advise Anglesey to give the
Crop_lines\123_handwritten_347_g06-045p\line_2.jpg	system a trial, adding that it was being cultivated with
Crop_lines\123_handwritten_347_g06-045p\line_3.jpg	extraordinary success in France and Italy, and that he
Crop_lines\123_handwritten_347_g06-045p\line_4.jpg	himself was being treated under a doctor who had
Crop_lines\123_handwritten_347_g06-045p\line_5.jpg	studied under its founder, the aged Dr. Samuel

Crop_lines\132_handwritten_348_g06-050r\line_4.jpg	a strong, energetic man with a gentle and charming
Crop_lines\132_handwritten_348_g06-050r\line_5.jpg	character, even-tempered and sedate, not easily

Crop_lines\134_handwritten_354_g07-069a\line_0.jpg	He had gone to Byron’s cousin, now 7th
Crop_lines\134_handwritten_354_g07-069a\line_1.jpg	lord, and had got him to compose an
Crop_lines\134_handwritten_354_g07-069a\line_2.jpg	affidavit to the effect that, whereas he
Crop_lines\134_handwritten_354_g07-069a\line_3.jpg	had formerly been reluctant to approve the
Crop_lines\134_handwritten_354_g07-069a\line_4.jpg	publication unless it had first been
Crop_lines\134_handwritten_354_g07-069a\line_5.jpg	examined by the relatives and friends of
Crop_lines\134_handwritten_354_g07-069a\line_6.jpg	his predecessor, he had now read the
Crop_lines\134_handwritten_354_g07-069a\line_7.jpg	book and was content for it to be
Crop_lines\134_handwritten_354_g07-069a\line_8.jpg	issued without that precaution.
Crop_lines\135_handwritten_354_g07-071a\line_0.jpg	There were few things in Augusta’s whole
Crop_lines\135_handwritten_354_g07-071a\line_1.jpg	life, full of calamities though it was, that
Crop_lines\135_handwritten_354_g07-071a\line_2.jpg	hurt her more than this contemptuous slight
Crop_lines\135_handwritten_354_g07-071a\line_3.jpg	from George Anson Byron, whom she had
Crop_lines\135_handwritten_354_g07-071a\line_4.jpg	loved with an unswerving loyalty, and had looked
Crop_lines\135_handwritten_354_g07-071a\line_5.jpg	on as her intimate friend. Moreover, he
Crop_lines\135_handwritten_354_g07-071a\line_6.jpg	was without the right to make such
Crop_lines\135_handwritten_354_g07-071a\line_7.jpg	pronouncements: he had inherited nothing
Crop_lines\135_handwritten_354_g07-071a\line_8.jpg	from her brother but his title, whereas
Crop_lines\135_handwritten_354_g07-071a\line_9.jpg	she was not only of nearer consanguinity
Crop_lines\135_handwritten_354_g07-071a\line_10.jpg	but the chosen recipient of his property.
Crop_lines\136_handwritten_354_g07-074a\line_0.jpg	These, if she had only known it, were
Crop_lines\136_handwritten_354_g07-074a\line_1.jpg	precisely the reasons why her cousin took
Crop_lines\136_handwritten_354_g07-074a\line_2.jpg	pleasure in the opportunity of annoying her.
Crop_lines\136_handwritten_354_g07-074a\line_3.jpg	Lady Byron did not like Augusta to have
Crop_lines\136_handwritten_354_g07-074a\line_4.jpg	intimate friends, and in every instance where
Crop_lines\136_handwritten_354_g07-074a\line_5.jpg	the occasion was granted her, she managed
Crop_lines\136_handwritten_354_g07-074a\line_6.jpg	to find some excuse for bestowing, in whole
Crop_lines\136_handwritten_354_g07-074a\line_7.jpg	or in part, those confidences which never
Crop_lines\136_handwritten_354_g07-074a\line_8.jpg	failed to leave her audience agape with
Crop_lines\136_handwritten_354_g07-074a\line_9.jpg	wonder at her magnanimity and Augusta’s
Crop_lines\136_handwritten_354_g07-074a\line_10.jpg	wickedness.
Crop_lines\137_handwritten_354_g07-077a\line_0.jpg	George Anson Byron had seen enough of
Crop_lines\137_handwritten_354_g07-077a\line_1.jpg	the poet’s atrocious conduct as a husband
Crop_lines\137_handwritten_354_g07-077a\line_2.jpg	to be aware that Augusta, so far from
Crop_lines\137_handwritten_354_g07-077a\line_3.jpg	being responsible for the collapse of the
Crop_lines\137_handwritten_354_g07-077a\line_4.jpg	marriage, had been Lady Byron’s greatest
Crop_lines\137_handwritten_354_g07-077a\line_5.jpg	support and comfort at the time; but it
Crop_lines\137_handwritten_354_g07-077a\line_6.jpg	had been deemed necessary all the
Crop_lines\137_handwritten_354_g07-077a\line_7.jpg	same to enlighten him as to the suspicions
Crop_lines\137_handwritten_354_g07-077a\line_8.jpg	in the background, and he had repeated
Crop_lines\137_handwritten_354_g07-077a\line_9.jpg	them to his newly married wife.
Crop_lines\138_handwritten_369_h02-028\line_0.jpg	We were assured by our expert witnesses on this
Crop_lines\138_handwritten_369_h02-028\line_1.jpg	subject that, with the apparatus at present to hand, the
Crop_lines\138_handwritten_369_h02-028\line_2.jpg	preliminary sniffing of the gases immediately before
Crop_lines\138_handwritten_369_h02-028\line_3.jpg	administering them to a patient was a recognised and
Crop_lines\138_handwritten_369_h02-028\line_4.jpg	necessary precaution. We accepted this. 10. In view of
Crop_lines\138_handwritten_369_h02-028\line_5.jpg	the heavy and direct responsibility carried by every
Crop_lines\138_handwritten_369_h02-028\line_6.jpg	anaesthetist we were convinced that anyone addicted
Crop_lines\138_handwritten_369_h02-028\line_7.jpg	to the inhalation of gases and vapours should never be
Crop_lines\138_handwritten_369_h02-028\line_8.jpg	entrusted with their administration.
Crop_lines\139_handwritten_370_h02-035\line_0.jpg	The main tasks of the Rolleston Committee, whose advice
Crop_lines\139_handwritten_370_h02-035\line_1.jpg	we were invited to review, were to advise on: (a) the
Crop_lines\139_handwritten_370_h02-035\line_2.jpg	circumstances, if any, in which the supply of morphine
Crop_lines\139_handwritten_370_h02-035\line_3.jpg	and heroin, and preparations containing these substances,
Crop_lines\139_handwritten_370_h02-035\line_4.jpg	to persons addicted to those drugs might be regarded
Crop_lines\139_handwritten_370_h02-035\line_5.jpg	as medically advisable; (b) the precautions which medical
Crop_lines\139_handwritten_370_h02-035\line_6.jpg	practitioners administering or prescribing morphine or
Crop_lines\139_handwritten_370_h02-035\line_7.jpg	heroin should adopt to avoid abuse and any
Crop_lines\139_handwritten_370_h02-035\line_8.jpg	administrative measures that seemed expedient to
Crop_lines\139_handwritten_370_h02-035\line_9.jpg	secure observance of those precautions.
Crop_lines\140_handwritten_380_h04-057\line_0.jpg	All types of household benefited from the improved
Crop_lines\140_handwritten_380_h04-057\line_1.jpg	supplies and lower prices of fresh fruit compared
Crop_lines\140_handwritten_380_h04-057\line_2.jpg	with 1958, but the increase in consumption was
Crop_lines\140_handwritten_380_h04-057\line_3.jpg	least in families con- taining children. 77. Total
Crop_lines\140_handwritten_380_h04-057\line_4.jpg	bread consumption was  virtually unchanged,
Crop_lines\140_handwritten_380_h04-057\line_5.jpg	although most types of household bought less
Crop_lines\140_handwritten_380_h04-057\line_6.jpg	white bread and more rolls and speciality
Crop_lines\140_handwritten_380_h04-057\line_7.jpg	breads than in 1958. Most groups increased
Crop_lines\140_handwritten_380_h04-057\line_8.jpg	their purchases of puddings, cakes and biscuits,
Crop_lines\140_handwritten_380_h04-057\line_9.jpg	but obtained less flour.
Crop_lines\141_handwritten_380_h04-061\line_0.jpg	78. Regression estimates of the expenditure on
Crop_lines\141_handwritten_380_h04-061\line_1.jpg	different commodities attributable to the adult
Crop_lines\141_handwritten_380_h04-061\line_2.jpg	couple and each additional child in a selected
Crop_lines\141_handwritten_380_h04-061\line_3.jpg	group of households consisting of childless couples
Crop_lines\141_handwritten_380_h04-061\line_4.jpg	(both under 55) and couples with different numbers
Crop_lines\141_handwritten_380_h04-061\line_5.jpg	of children were given for 1952-56 in Table 39 of
Crop_lines\141_handwritten_380_h04-061\line_6.jpg	the Annual Report for 1956. The younger childless
Crop_lines\141_handwritten_380_h04-061\line_7.jpg	couples are broadly comparable in age and family
Crop_lines\141_handwritten_380_h04-061\line_8.jpg	income with the family households, so that differences
Crop_lines\141_handwritten_380_h04-061\line_9.jpg	in food expenditure may be associated with the
Crop_lines\141_handwritten_380_h04-061\line_10.jpg	presence of children.
Crop_lines\142_handwritten_401_j04-012\line_0.jpg	Knowing the time of separation and the
Crop_lines\142_handwritten_401_j04-012\line_1.jpg	activity of the lead-210 solution, the ingrowth
Crop_lines\142_handwritten_401_j04-012\line_2.jpg	of the bismuth-210 can be calculated. The
Crop_lines\142_handwritten_401_j04-012\line_3.jpg	absolute activity of the reference standards
Crop_lines\142_handwritten_401_j04-012\line_4.jpg	can be calculated from the known activity
Crop_lines\142_handwritten_401_j04-012\line_5.jpg	of the lead-210 solution and the chemical
Crop_lines\142_handwritten_401_j04-012\line_6.jpg	yield, but this calculation is unnecessary
Crop_lines\142_handwritten_401_j04-012\line_7.jpg	provided the same lead carrier solution is
Crop_lines\142_handwritten_401_j04-012\line_8.jpg	used to prepare the reference standards
Crop_lines\142_handwritten_401_j04-012\line_9.jpg	and for the analyses
Crop_lines\143_handwritten_428_k02-102\line_0.jpg	There was still an ease in our conversation, but its
Crop_lines\143_handwritten_428_k02-102\line_1.jpg	scope was restricted. I felt that I could hardly make the
Crop_lines\143_handwritten_428_k02-102\line_2.jpg	usual enquiries and comments about Nigel’s various mistresses
Crop_lines\143_handwritten_428_k02-102\line_3.jpg	as I was accustomed to whenever I saw him, much as I
Crop_lines\143_handwritten_428_k02-102\line_4.jpg	wondered which of his girls was in favour at the moment.
Crop_lines\143_handwritten_428_k02-102\line_5.jpg	And I suppose he felt the same. We had only a few drinks,
Crop_lines\143_handwritten_428_k02-102\line_6.jpg	then decided to bathe and dress for a rather early
Crop_lines\143_handwritten_428_k02-102\line_7.jpg	dinner.
Crop_lines\144_handwritten_442_k04-028\line_0.jpg	I like to think it may have fallen from the dark
Crop_lines\144_handwritten_442_k04-028\line_1.jpg	hair of the Empress Messalina, as she crouched
Crop_lines\144_handwritten_442_k04-028\line_2.jpg	in terror in the gardens of Lucullus, awaiting
Crop_lines\144_handwritten_442_k04-028\line_3.jpg	the sword of the executioner.’ ’Ah!’ exclaimed
Crop_lines\144_handwritten_442_k04-028\line_4.jpg	Farnese, with a snigger. ’The old cuckold
Crop_lines\144_handwritten_442_k04-028\line_5.jpg	Claudius had the last word, after all. He
Crop_lines\144_handwritten_442_k04-028\line_6.jpg	knew how to deal with an adulterous wife,
Crop_lines\144_handwritten_442_k04-028\line_7.jpg	eh, Orsini?’
Crop_lines\145_handwritten_442_k04-033\line_0.jpg	If the duke made any reply to this, Vittoria did
Crop_lines\145_handwritten_442_k04-033\line_1.jpg	not hear it. Now they entered the long gallery
Crop_lines\145_handwritten_442_k04-033\line_2.jpg	where they dispersed and wandered around, admiring
Crop_lines\145_handwritten_442_k04-033\line_3.jpg	and commenting on the glowing hues and barbaric
Crop_lines\145_handwritten_442_k04-033\line_4.jpg	splendours of the tapestries Doria had brought
Crop_lines\145_handwritten_442_k04-033\line_5.jpg	back from Lepanto. After a short interval, Orsini
Crop_lines\145_handwritten_442_k04-033\line_6.jpg	found an opportunity to rejoin Vittoria.
Crop_lines\145_handwritten_442_k04-033\line_7.jpg	’We must talk further,’ he said in a low
Crop_lines\145_handwritten_442_k04-033\line_8.jpg	urgent voice. ’Where?’
Crop_lines\146_handwritten_445_k04-068\line_0.jpg	Her husband’s gentleness and amiability, his unselfish
Crop_lines\146_handwritten_445_k04-068\line_1.jpg	love for her, she regarded as signs of weakness. He was a
Crop_lines\146_handwritten_445_k04-068\line_2.jpg	futile creature who had not even proved capable of giving
Crop_lines\146_handwritten_445_k04-068\line_3.jpg	her a child. Whatever passion she had experienced in the
Crop_lines\146_handwritten_445_k04-068\line_4.jpg	first months of marriage had been ousted by contempt.
Crop_lines\146_handwritten_445_k04-068\line_5.jpg	She had never loved him. Her thoughts rushed to Orsini.
Crop_lines\146_handwritten_445_k04-068\line_6.jpg	Since the meeting in the Doria Palace, no word had
Crop_lines\146_handwritten_445_k04-068\line_7.jpg	come from him, and this silence oppressed her spirits
Crop_lines\146_handwritten_445_k04-068\line_8.jpg	with a weight of misgiving.
Crop_lines\147_handwritten_448_k04-099\line_0.jpg	Her thoughts at this moment were chaotic. The
Crop_lines\147_handwritten_448_k04-099\line_1.jpg	coach now turned in another direction, towards
Crop_lines\147_handwritten_448_k04-099\line_2.jpg	the wild and desolate region behind the baths.
Crop_lines\147_handwritten_448_k04-099\line_3.jpg	It was sparsely inhabited, dotted with fallow fields
Crop_lines\147_handwritten_448_k04-099\line_4.jpg	and terraced vineyards, and here and there jutted
Crop_lines\147_handwritten_448_k04-099\line_5.jpg	a brown outcrop of flower-wreathed ruins, a pathetic
Crop_lines\147_handwritten_448_k04-099\line_6.jpg	reminder of Rome’s former greatness.
Crop_lines\148_handwritten_448_k04-103\line_0.jpg	In this region of Monti most of the public baths
Crop_lines\148_handwritten_448_k04-103\line_1.jpg	had been built in the time of the Caesars, but with the
Crop_lines\148_handwritten_448_k04-103\line_2.jpg	breaking of the aqueducts during the barbarian invasions
Crop_lines\148_handwritten_448_k04-103\line_3.jpg	the baths had lost their purpose; they had become
Crop_lines\148_handwritten_448_k04-103\line_4.jpg	stone quarries and their precious marble had. been
Crop_lines\148_handwritten_448_k04-103\line_5.jpg	burnt for lime. Now escaped criminals and bandits
Crop_lines\148_handwritten_448_k04-103\line_6.jpg	used these quarries as hiding places, to the danger
Crop_lines\148_handwritten_448_k04-103\line_7.jpg	of travellers in the district.
Crop_lines\149_handwritten_449_k04-106\line_0.jpg	As they lumbered past at a rattling pace, Vittoria
Crop_lines\149_handwritten_449_k04-106\line_1.jpg	could see a wisp of smoke curling above the fire of a
Crop_lines\149_handwritten_449_k04-106\line_2.jpg	gypsy encampment and a few tatterdemalion creatures
Crop_lines\149_handwritten_449_k04-106\line_3.jpg	gathered about it, cooking their frugal meal. These
Crop_lines\149_handwritten_449_k04-106\line_4.jpg	were left far behind. An old man belabouring an
Crop_lines\149_handwritten_449_k04-106\line_5.jpg	overladen donkey, and a withered crone appeared
Crop_lines\149_handwritten_449_k04-106\line_6.jpg	on the horizon, were overtaken and forgotten.
Crop_lines\150_handwritten_453_k04-156\line_0.jpg	In that case, he reverted to French, I shall be obliged
Crop_lines\150_handwritten_453_k04-156\line_1.jpg	to lift you from the coach. Without answering him, she
Crop_lines\150_handwritten_453_k04-156\line_2.jpg	rose, and bending over the agitated girl, said softly:
Crop_lines\150_handwritten_453_k04-156\line_3.jpg	No one will harm you, Lucia. Remain here. Ignoring his
Crop_lines\150_handwritten_453_k04-156\line_4.jpg	proffered. hand, she stepped from the vehicle. Will you
Crop_lines\150_handwritten_453_k04-156\line_5.jpg	be so good as to order your men not to molest my
Crop_lines\150_handwritten_453_k04-156\line_6.jpg	maid she said coldly to Orsini.
Crop_lines\151_handwritten_453_k04-163\line_0.jpg	She is absolutely safe,’ he replied; but he turned,
Crop_lines\151_handwritten_453_k04-163\line_1.jpg	nevertheless, to the man who had peered into the
Crop_lines\151_handwritten_453_k04-163\line_2.jpg	coach, whom he had addressed as Luigi, and gave him sharp
Crop_lines\151_handwritten_453_k04-163\line_3.jpg	instructions on the matter. Vittoria stood looking about her
Crop_lines\151_handwritten_453_k04-163\line_4.jpg	breathing the scent of thyme. The land at her feet sloped
Crop_lines\151_handwritten_453_k04-163\line_5.jpg	away into a tiny valley beyond which, on the crest
Crop_lines\151_handwritten_453_k04-163\line_6.jpg	of a wooded hill-side, the ruins of a small temple
Crop_lines\151_handwritten_453_k04-163\line_7.jpg	were etched against the clear blue of the sky.
Crop_lines\152_handwritten_454_k07-059a\line_0.jpg	He forgot time and place. He, the master, was gently
Crop_lines\152_handwritten_454_k07-059a\line_1.jpg	led along erotic paths which he knew existed, but
Crop_lines\152_handwritten_454_k07-059a\line_2.jpg	had never trodden. He learned how to use his
Crop_lines\152_handwritten_454_k07-059a\line_3.jpg	hands, how to adore that body without haste, how
Crop_lines\152_handwritten_454_k07-059a\line_4.jpg	to caress every inch with his mouth as well, to
Crop_lines\152_handwritten_454_k07-059a\line_5.jpg	creep down along her smooth muscles till he lost
Crop_lines\152_handwritten_454_k07-059a\line_6.jpg	himself in a rapture of kisses in places he’d
Crop_lines\152_handwritten_454_k07-059a\line_7.jpg	dreamed of, where life began to ooze and quickened
Crop_lines\152_handwritten_454_k07-059a\line_8.jpg	his heart beat to a thunder.
Crop_lines\153_handwritten_454_k07-063a\line_0.jpg	He looked at her. Head thrown back in a pool of hair,
Crop_lines\153_handwritten_454_k07-063a\line_1.jpg	her blood-red lips parted and the beating of her
Crop_lines\153_handwritten_454_k07-063a\line_2.jpg	heart in the full throat. Her mouth did things he
Crop_lines\153_handwritten_454_k07-063a\line_3.jpg	thought no human being could stand without
Crop_lines\153_handwritten_454_k07-063a\line_4.jpg	dying, but he went on living in an ocean of
Crop_lines\153_handwritten_454_k07-063a\line_5.jpg	voluptuousness, that swelled and ebbed over him,
Crop_lines\153_handwritten_454_k07-063a\line_6.jpg	under him, in him and through him...
Crop_lines\154_handwritten_454_k07-067a\line_0.jpg	He was having a ball! He twiddled the TV set with
Crop_lines\154_handwritten_454_k07-067a\line_1.jpg	shaking hands. She sat calmly on the bed smoking
Crop_lines\154_handwritten_454_k07-067a\line_2.jpg	a cigarette. His face was white with two red
Crop_lines\154_handwritten_454_k07-067a\line_3.jpg	blotches. Hers was flushed and lovely. O.K. teacher!
Crop_lines\154_handwritten_454_k07-067a\line_4.jpg	Was that any better? You know it was! You don’t
Crop_lines\154_handwritten_454_k07-067a\line_5.jpg	need teaching, only a little coaxing.
Crop_lines\155_handwritten_454_k07-077\line_0.jpg	He sat down and ran his finger down along her
Crop_lines\155_handwritten_454_k07-077\line_1.jpg	spine. Do you love me now? Like yesterday! I’m
Crop_lines\155_handwritten_454_k07-077\line_2.jpg	extremely fond of you. The fact that you’re beginning
Crop_lines\155_handwritten_454_k07-077\line_3.jpg	to satisfy my physical wants does not change that.
Crop_lines\155_handwritten_454_k07-077\line_4.jpg	Before long you’ll give me the satisfaction that’ll set
Crop_lines\155_handwritten_454_k07-077\line_5.jpg	me rocking on my feet, but I’ll still be only fond of
Crop_lines\155_handwritten_454_k07-077\line_6.jpg	you. But you wouldn’t marry me?
Crop_lines\156_handwritten_454_k07-085\line_0.jpg	No. I’m not your type. I’d make you miserable.
Crop_lines\156_handwritten_454_k07-085\line_1.jpg	I mean that. I’d very probably be unfaithful and
Crop_lines\156_handwritten_454_k07-085\line_2.jpg	that’d kill you. Then I’d be unfaithful too, to teach
Crop_lines\156_handwritten_454_k07-085\line_3.jpg	you a lesson. It wouldn’t work. You’d do it to
Crop_lines\156_handwritten_454_k07-085\line_4.jpg	spite me. I would never do it for that reason.
Crop_lines\156_handwritten_454_k07-085\line_5.jpg	To me it’d be immaterial whether you’d retaliate
Crop_lines\156_handwritten_454_k07-085\line_6.jpg	or not. You’d go crazy if that situation arose.
Crop_lines\157_handwritten_468_l01-133\line_0.jpg	”Mum, this is Maggie. I’m going to marry her,
Crop_lines\157_handwritten_468_l01-133\line_1.jpg	and I’d like her to come and live with us.”
Crop_lines\157_handwritten_468_l01-133\line_2.jpg	Maggie was plump and plain with a pleasing
Crop_lines\157_handwritten_468_l01-133\line_3.jpg	smile, a placid nature, and a slowmoving
Crop_lines\157_handwritten_468_l01-133\line_4.jpg	but methodical mind. For twenty years she
Crop_lines\157_handwritten_468_l01-133\line_5.jpg	had worked in the bottling-store at the bre-
Crop_lines\157_handwritten_468_l01-133\line_6.jpg	wery, and Grace heard with astonishment
Crop_lines\157_handwritten_468_l01-133\line_7.jpg	that Fred had known her on and off
Crop_lines\157_handwritten_468_l01-133\line_8.jpg	for nearly as long.
Crop_lines\158_handwritten_481_l04-020\line_0.jpg	'Of course, Kitty’, he said fervently, his eyes misty
Crop_lines\158_handwritten_481_l04-020\line_1.jpg	behind their thick lenses. ’Well, I’ll be off now. See you
Crop_lines\158_handwritten_481_l04-020\line_2.jpg	tomorrow... and thank you...’ "So long, Bob’, she said,
Crop_lines\158_handwritten_481_l04-020\line_3.jpg	waving her hand to him. Harry followed him to the
Crop_lines\158_handwritten_481_l04-020\line_4.jpg	door, opened it for him and stood outside on the step,
Crop_lines\158_handwritten_481_l04-020\line_5.jpg	looking up at the sky, where a few pale stars shone
Crop_lines\158_handwritten_481_l04-020\line_6.jpg	between puffs of light cumulus cloud.
Crop_lines\159_handwritten_481_l04-026\line_0.jpg	'Nice night’, he remarked affably. ’But they forecast rain
Crop_lines\159_handwritten_481_l04-026\line_1.jpg	for tomorrow.’ ’Do they?’ Bone glanced up at the sky, his
Crop_lines\159_handwritten_481_l04-026\line_2.jpg	thoughts elsewhere. Personally, he didn’t care if it rained cats
Crop_lines\159_handwritten_481_l04-026\line_3.jpg	and dogs and he knew that Harry didn’t either. He waited,
Crop_lines\159_handwritten_481_l04-026\line_4.jpg	pulling on his gloves and adjusting his hat. "Look, Bob,’
Crop_lines\159_handwritten_481_l04-026\line_5.jpg	Harry began, after a brief silence, ’I don’t mean to
Crop_lines\159_handwritten_481_l04-026\line_6.jpg	butt in, but if you take my advice you’ll'are no
Crop_lines\159_handwritten_481_l04-026\line_7.jpg	more truck with ’er.’
Crop_lines\160_handwritten_486_l04-093\line_0.jpg	He lifted out the heavy bundles of notes and knelt on the floor
Crop_lines\160_handwritten_486_l04-093\line_1.jpg	to count them. Of course, he remembered being in a great hurry to get
Crop_lines\160_handwritten_486_l04-093\line_2.jpg	that fifty pounds for Kitty! Obviously he had been careless in
Crop_lines\160_handwritten_486_l04-093\line_3.jpg	replacing the panel, but the possibility of anyone having
Crop_lines\160_handwritten_486_l04-093\line_4.jpg	discovered his hiding-place gave him something of a sock.
Crop_lines\160_handwritten_486_l04-093\line_5.jpg	As he replaced the bundles of notes, he withdrew the tin
Crop_lines\160_handwritten_486_l04-093\line_6.jpg	box from its hiding-place and locked it inside the
Crop_lines\160_handwritten_486_l04-093\line_7.jpg	cupboard.
Crop_lines\161_handwritten_491_l04-141\line_0.jpg	'Easy enough along that stretch of coast road in winter,
Crop_lines\161_handwritten_491_l04-141\line_1.jpg	believe me’, Roddy affirmed solemnly. ’He probably caught
Crop_lines\161_handwritten_491_l04-141\line_2.jpg	the next boat across the channel and has been lying low
Crop_lines\161_handwritten_491_l04-141\line_3.jpg	with the money somewhere.’ Hugh nodded. ’I realized that
Crop_lines\161_handwritten_491_l04-141\line_4.jpg	after my talk with Mrs. Lawford. There are a dozen countries
Crop_lines\161_handwritten_491_l04-141\line_5.jpg	where a man could easily hide up and change the money
Crop_lines\161_handwritten_491_l04-141\line_6.jpg	without danger.
Crop_lines\162_handwritten_493_l04-163\line_0.jpg	Stealing from cars is about the commonest
Crop_lines\162_handwritten_493_l04-163\line_1.jpg	kind of crime in the book. There’s nothing
Crop_lines\162_handwritten_493_l04-163\line_2.jpg	that absolutely ties the missing money to the
Crop_lines\162_handwritten_493_l04-163\line_3.jpg	circumstances of your father’s death, that’s
Crop_lines\162_handwritten_493_l04-163\line_4.jpg	the point. Same with the passport. It’s gone
Crop_lines\162_handwritten_493_l04-163\line_5.jpg	and that’s that. It may turn up in a dustbin
Crop_lines\162_handwritten_493_l04-163\line_6.jpg	somewhere or at the back of a drawer. As
Crop_lines\162_handwritten_493_l04-163\line_7.jpg	far as the police are concerned there’s nothing
Crop_lines\162_handwritten_493_l04-163\line_8.jpg	to go on.
Crop_lines\163_handwritten_493_l04-170\line_0.jpg	In our own minds we may be pretty sure what
Crop_lines\163_handwritten_493_l04-170\line_1.jpg	happened, but that’s not good enough for them.
Crop_lines\163_handwritten_493_l04-170\line_2.jpg	That suicide letter did the trick - definite proof
Crop_lines\163_handwritten_493_l04-170\line_3.jpg	that your father took his life, backed by
Crop_lines\163_handwritten_493_l04-170\line_4.jpg	medical evidence and the fingerprint chaps.’
Crop_lines\163_handwritten_493_l04-170\line_5.jpg	A little man with thin brown hair and a
Crop_lines\163_handwritten_493_l04-170\line_6.jpg	ruddy complexion came over and greeted
Crop_lines\163_handwritten_493_l04-170\line_7.jpg	them.
Crop_lines\164_handwritten_496_l07-080\line_0.jpg	”You can’t very well stop me.” ”I can
Crop_lines\164_handwritten_496_l07-080\line_1.jpg	do better than that. If we were to
Crop_lines\164_handwritten_496_l07-080\line_2.jpg	get married now I could come
Crop_lines\164_handwritten_496_l07-080\line_3.jpg	with you.” I looked down at my
Crop_lines\164_handwritten_496_l07-080\line_4.jpg	plate, not daring to let him see
Crop_lines\164_handwritten_496_l07-080\line_5.jpg	how much the idea appealed to
Crop_lines\164_handwritten_496_l07-080\line_6.jpg	me, reminding myself that he could
Crop_lines\164_handwritten_496_l07-080\line_7.jpg	only have said such a thing
Crop_lines\164_handwritten_496_l07-080\line_8.jpg	because he did not know the
Crop_lines\164_handwritten_496_l07-080\line_9.jpg	whole truth.
Crop_lines\165_handwritten_496_l07-085\line_0.jpg	”And I can’t allow that,” I said.
Crop_lines\165_handwritten_496_l07-085\line_1.jpg	"Deadlock,” said Max. ”No, it isn’t.
Crop_lines\165_handwritten_496_l07-085\line_2.jpg	I’m determined to go, and by myself,
Crop_lines\165_handwritten_496_l07-085\line_3.jpg	whatever you say.” ”I was afraid of
Crop_lines\165_handwritten_496_l07-085\line_4.jpg	that.” He sounded resigned but none
Crop_lines\165_handwritten_496_l07-085\line_5.jpg	the less hopeful. ” You’re a very
Crop_lines\165_handwritten_496_l07-085\line_6.jpg	wilful woman but I’ll change
Crop_lines\165_handwritten_496_l07-085\line_7.jpg	your mind for you one of these
Crop_lines\165_handwritten_496_l07-085\line_8.jpg	days.
Crop_lines\166_handwritten_496_l07-103\line_0.jpg	”You can see it any time you like,”
Crop_lines\166_handwritten_496_l07-103\line_1.jpg	he told me. ”’The sooner the better.
Crop_lines\166_handwritten_496_l07-103\line_2.jpg	If you can get to Bletcham this
Crop_lines\166_handwritten_496_l07-103\line_3.jpg	evening I’ll run you up there
Crop_lines\166_handwritten_496_l07-103\line_4.jpg	in the car.” ”That’s very nice of
Crop_lines\166_handwritten_496_l07-103\line_5.jpg	you.” ”Nice, nothing. I told you,
Crop_lines\166_handwritten_496_l07-103\line_6.jpg	I’m mad about boats. Seven
Crop_lines\166_handwritten_496_l07-103\line_7.jpg	thirty d you?
Crop_lines\167_handwritten_499_m01-000\line_0.jpg	A shudder, more mental than physical, ran
Crop_lines\167_handwritten_499_m01-000\line_1.jpg	through him, and his mind seemed to
Crop_lines\167_handwritten_499_m01-000\line_2.jpg	melt away into emptiness. His bulging
Crop_lines\167_handwritten_499_m01-000\line_3.jpg	eyes caught the reclining form of Heather,
Crop_lines\167_handwritten_499_m01-000\line_4.jpg	who was still repeating in sing-song:
Crop_lines\167_handwritten_499_m01-000\line_5.jpg	”... I will not give in...” He stared at her
Crop_lines\167_handwritten_499_m01-000\line_6.jpg	blankly, mouthing an incoherent gabble
Crop_lines\167_handwritten_499_m01-000\line_7.jpg	of half words.
Crop_lines\168_handwritten_522_m02-055\line_0.jpg	They had been married for six years, but the
Crop_lines\168_handwritten_522_m02-055\line_1.jpg	salary raise, on the expectation of which they
Crop_lines\168_handwritten_522_m02-055\line_2.jpg	had done so, had not materialised. ”Do you
Crop_lines\168_handwritten_522_m02-055\line_3.jpg	know, I had to send back our bedroom
Crop_lines\168_handwritten_522_m02-055\line_4.jpg	furniture in the second year,” she moaned. She
Crop_lines\168_handwritten_522_m02-055\line_5.jpg	had contacts in political circles, a school-
Crop_lines\168_handwritten_522_m02-055\line_6.jpg	friend of hers having married Lester Peron,
Crop_lines\168_handwritten_522_m02-055\line_7.jpg	a Mocrat Senator with a seat on the
Crop_lines\168_handwritten_522_m02-055\line_8.jpg	(literally) all-powerful Rocket Release
Crop_lines\168_handwritten_522_m02-055\line_9.jpg	Board.
Crop_lines\169_handwritten_535_m02-112\line_0.jpg	So once again the metaphysics were depressing,
Crop_lines\169_handwritten_535_m02-112\line_1.jpg	and in absolute contrast to the physical display.
Crop_lines\169_handwritten_535_m02-112\line_2.jpg	Mos have an un-American love of parades, and
Crop_lines\169_handwritten_535_m02-112\line_3.jpg	these young ones, on parade for jobs which they
Crop_lines\169_handwritten_535_m02-112\line_4.jpg	had to get to pay off their college bills, were naturally
Crop_lines\169_handwritten_535_m02-112\line_5.jpg	putting their best foot forward.
Crop_lines\170_handwritten_549_m04-190\line_0.jpg	He saluted, and left the presence, very crestfallen...
Crop_lines\170_handwritten_549_m04-190\line_1.jpg	Time passed. The bus climbed, and went quietly
Crop_lines\170_handwritten_549_m04-190\line_2.jpg	into orbit. Time passed. The Rev. Edwards’ pulpit
Crop_lines\170_handwritten_549_m04-190\line_3.jpg	remained empty. And so did the arms of Dai
Crop_lines\170_handwritten_549_m04-190\line_4.jpg	Pugh. How could they be otherwise, when his
Crop_lines\170_handwritten_549_m04-190\line_5.jpg	beloved was circling the Poles at three-and-a-
Crop_lines\170_handwritten_549_m04-190\line_6.jpg	quarter-hour intervals, regular as clockwork?
Crop_lines\170_handwritten_549_m04-190\line_7.jpg	Time passed. Everyone said, ” Pity about Megan
Crop_lines\170_handwritten_549_m04-190\line_8.jpg	Thomas, isn’t it,” as though they didn’t really think
Crop_lines\170_handwritten_549_m04-190\line_9.jpg	it was a pity at all; as, indeed, they didn’t.
Crop_lines\171_handwritten_549_m04-200\line_0.jpg	LOCAL BUS DISAPPEARS announced the
Crop_lines\171_handwritten_549_m04-200\line_1.jpg	Dinas Advertiser. But the London papers ignored
Crop_lines\171_handwritten_549_m04-200\line_2.jpg	the whole affair. Ifor Evans reported his loss
Crop_lines\171_handwritten_549_m04-200\line_3.jpg	to the police. But they only tuttutted. "Lost
Crop_lines\171_handwritten_549_m04-200\line_4.jpg	a bus, is it. Very careless.” That was their
Crop_lines\171_handwritten_549_m04-200\line_5.jpg	attitude. Now if there’d been a good old accident,
Crop_lines\171_handwritten_549_m04-200\line_6.jpg	they could have measured up the road and
Crop_lines\171_handwritten_549_m04-200\line_7.jpg	taken an interest.
Crop_lines\172_handwritten_549_m04-209\line_0.jpg	But losing a bus! People were always losing
Crop_lines\172_handwritten_549_m04-209\line_1.jpg	things. You’d be surprised, they said. So it
Crop_lines\172_handwritten_549_m04-209\line_2.jpg	seemed, for a time, that the whole affair would
Crop_lines\172_handwritten_549_m04-209\line_3.jpg	be written off as one of those unexplained
Crop_lines\172_handwritten_549_m04-209\line_4.jpg	mysteries, like the Marie Celeste. Then things
Crop_lines\172_handwritten_549_m04-209\line_5.jpg	began to happen... But what about the voyagers?
Crop_lines\172_handwritten_549_m04-209\line_6.jpg	you will be asking.
Crop_lines\173_handwritten_549_m04-216\line_0.jpg	Well, the Rev. Edwards had taken command. ”Our
Crop_lines\173_handwritten_549_m04-216\line_1.jpg	position,” he said, ”is somewhat analogous to
Crop_lines\173_handwritten_549_m04-216\line_2.jpg	that of a castaway on a desert island. Now
Crop_lines\173_handwritten_549_m04-216\line_3.jpg	what does such a person do? He signals
Crop_lines\173_handwritten_549_m04-216\line_4.jpg	his position by lighting bonfires or hoisting a
Crop_lines\173_handwritten_549_m04-216\line_5.jpg	flag on a palm tree. And he tries to ensure
Crop_lines\173_handwritten_549_m04-216\line_6.jpg	a supply of food.”
Crop_lines\174_handwritten_549_m04-222\line_0.jpg	”Can’t go lighting bonfires on this bus,”
Crop_lines\174_handwritten_549_m04-222\line_1.jpg	the conductor said firmly. ”Contrary to the
Crop_lines\174_handwritten_549_m04-222\line_2.jpg	Company’s Regulations.” Of course not,” agreed
Crop_lines\174_handwritten_549_m04-222\line_3.jpg	the minister. ”No, we have another way of signalling
Crop_lines\174_handwritten_549_m04-222\line_4.jpg	our position. The driver must sound his horn
Crop_lines\174_handwritten_549_m04-222\line_5.jpg	continuously.” Gave him a look, the driver did.
Crop_lines\174_handwritten_549_m04-222\line_6.jpg	”Where you think we are?” he asked rudely.
Crop_lines\174_handwritten_549_m04-222\line_7.jpg	”Dinas High Street?”
Crop_lines\175_handwritten_552_m06-031\line_0.jpg	'But we -’ ’Stop your stupid talk, woman!’ ’We are-’
Crop_lines\175_handwritten_552_m06-031\line_1.jpg	’Be silent, woman, and listen,’ Band Appa Bondi said.
Crop_lines\175_handwritten_552_m06-031\line_2.jpg	’We know much,’ repeated the Chief Captive. 'Some
Crop_lines\175_handwritten_552_m06-031\line_3.jpg	things we will tell you. All who make the journey from
Crop_lines\175_handwritten_552_m06-031\line_4.jpg	the Heavy World become changed. Some die. Most live
Crop_lines\175_handwritten_552_m06-031\line_5.jpg	and grow wings. Between the worlds are many strong
Crop_lines\175_handwritten_552_m06-031\line_6.jpg	rays, not seen or felt, which change our bodies.
Crop_lines\176_handwritten_552_m06-042\line_0.jpg	When you come here, when you come to the True
Crop_lines\176_handwritten_552_m06-042\line_1.jpg	World, you become a true human. The grub of the
Crop_lines\176_handwritten_552_m06-042\line_2.jpg	tigerfly is not a tigerfly until it changes. So humans
Crop_lines\176_handwritten_552_m06-042\line_3.jpg	change.’ ’I cannot know what he says,’ Haris said
Crop_lines\176_handwritten_552_m06-042\line_4.jpg	stubbornly, throwing himself down. But Lily-yo and
Crop_lines\176_handwritten_552_m06-042\line_5.jpg	Flor were listening.
Crop_lines\177_handwritten_552_m06-048\line_0.jpg	To this True World, as you call it, we come to die,’
Crop_lines\177_handwritten_552_m06-048\line_1.jpg	Lily-yo said, doubtingly. The Captive with the
Crop_lines\177_handwritten_552_m06-048\line_2.jpg	fleshless jaw said, "The grub of the tigerfly thinks
Crop_lines\177_handwritten_552_m06-048\line_3.jpg	it dies when it changes into a tigerfly.’ 'You are still
Crop_lines\177_handwritten_552_m06-048\line_4.jpg	young,’ said the Chief Captive. 'You begin newly here.
Crop_lines\177_handwritten_552_m06-048\line_5.jpg	Where are your souls?’ Lily-yo and Flor looked at
Crop_lines\177_handwritten_552_m06-048\line_6.jpg	each other. In their flight from the 4wiltmilt they had
Crop_lines\177_handwritten_552_m06-048\line_7.jpg	heedlessly thrown down their souls.
Crop_lines\178_handwritten_552_m06-056\line_0.jpg	Haris had trampled on his. It was unthinkable!
Crop_lines\178_handwritten_552_m06-056\line_1.jpg	'You see. You needed them no more. You are still
Crop_lines\178_handwritten_552_m06-056\line_2.jpg	young. You may be able to have babies. Some of those
Crop_lines\178_handwritten_552_m06-056\line_3.jpg	babies may be born with wings.’ The Captive with
Crop_lines\178_handwritten_552_m06-056\line_4.jpg	the boneless arms added, ’Some may be born wrong,
Crop_lines\178_handwritten_552_m06-056\line_5.jpg	as we are. Some may be born right.’
Crop_lines\179_handwritten_552_m06-067\line_0.jpg	'You are too foul to live!’ Haris growled. ’Why are
Crop_lines\179_handwritten_552_m06-067\line_1.jpg	you not killed?’ ’Because we know all things,’ the
Crop_lines\179_handwritten_552_m06-067\line_2.jpg	Chief Captive said. Suddenly his second head roused
Crop_lines\179_handwritten_552_m06-067\line_3.jpg	itself and declared, ’To be a good shape is not all
Crop_lines\179_handwritten_552_m06-067\line_4.jpg	in life. To know is also good. Because we cannot move
Crop_lines\179_handwritten_552_m06-067\line_5.jpg	well we can - think. This tribe of the True World
Crop_lines\179_handwritten_552_m06-067\line_6.jpg	is good and knows these things.
Crop_lines\180_handwritten_552_m06-076\line_0.jpg	So it lets us rule it.’ Flor and Lily-yo
Crop_lines\180_handwritten_552_m06-076\line_1.jpg	muttered together. ’Do you say that you poor
Crop_lines\180_handwritten_552_m06-076\line_2.jpg	Captives rule the True World?’ Lily-yo asked
Crop_lines\180_handwritten_552_m06-076\line_3.jpg	at last. ’We do.’ ’Then why are you captives?’
Crop_lines\180_handwritten_552_m06-076\line_4.jpg	The flyman with ear lobes and thumbs connected,
Crop_lines\180_handwritten_552_m06-076\line_5.jpg	making his perpetual little gesture of protest,
Crop_lines\180_handwritten_552_m06-076\line_6.jpg	spoke for the first time.
Crop_lines\181_handwritten_552_m06-083\line_0.jpg	'To rule is to serve, woman. Those who bear power
Crop_lines\181_handwritten_552_m06-083\line_1.jpg	are slaves to it. Only an outcast is free. Because
Crop_lines\181_handwritten_552_m06-083\line_2.jpg	we are Captives, we have the time to talk and
Crop_lines\181_handwritten_552_m06-083\line_3.jpg	think and plan and know. Those who know
Crop_lines\181_handwritten_552_m06-083\line_4.jpg	command the knives of others.’ ’No hurt will
Crop_lines\181_handwritten_552_m06-083\line_5.jpg	come to you, Lily-yo,’ Band Appa Bondi added.
Crop_lines\181_handwritten_552_m06-083\line_6.jpg	’You will live among us and enjoy your life free
Crop_lines\181_handwritten_552_m06-083\line_7.jpg	from harm.’
Crop_lines\182_handwritten_552_m06-091\line_0.jpg	'No!’ the Chief Captive said with both mouths.
Crop_lines\182_handwritten_552_m06-091\line_1.jpg	’Before she can enjoy, Lily-yo and her companion
Crop_lines\182_handwritten_552_m06-091\line_2.jpg	Flor -this other man creature is plainly useless -
Crop_lines\182_handwritten_552_m06-091\line_3.jpg	must help our great plan.’ ’The invasion?’ Bondi
Crop_lines\182_handwritten_552_m06-091\line_4.jpg	asked. "What else? Flor and Lily-yo, you arrive
Crop_lines\182_handwritten_552_m06-091\line_5.jpg	here at a good time. Memories of the Heavy World
Crop_lines\182_handwritten_552_m06-091\line_6.jpg	and its savage life are still fresh in you.
Crop_lines\183_handwritten_552_m06-098\line_0.jpg	We need such memories. So we ask you to go
Crop_lines\183_handwritten_552_m06-098\line_1.jpg	back there on a great plan we have.’ ’Go back?’
Crop_lines\183_handwritten_552_m06-098\line_2.jpg	gasped Flor. 'Yes. We plan to attack the Heavy
Crop_lines\183_handwritten_552_m06-098\line_3.jpg	World. You must help to lead our force.’ The long
Crop_lines\183_handwritten_552_m06-098\line_4.jpg	afternoon of eternity wore on, that long golden road
Crop_lines\183_handwritten_552_m06-098\line_5.jpg	of an afternoon that would somewhere lead to
Crop_lines\183_handwritten_552_m06-098\line_6.jpg	everlasting night.
Crop_lines\184_handwritten_552_m06-106\line_0.jpg	Motion there was, but motion without event - except
Crop_lines\184_handwritten_552_m06-106\line_1.jpg	for those negligible events that seemed so large to
Crop_lines\184_handwritten_552_m06-106\line_2.jpg	the creatures participating in them. For Lily-yo, Flor
Crop_lines\184_handwritten_552_m06-106\line_3.jpg	and Haris there were many events. Chief of these was
Crop_lines\184_handwritten_552_m06-106\line_4.jpg	that they learned to fly properly. The pains associated
Crop_lines\184_handwritten_552_m06-106\line_5.jpg	with their wings soon died away as the wonderful
Crop_lines\184_handwritten_552_m06-106\line_6.jpg	new flesh and tendon strengthened. To sail up in the
Crop_lines\184_handwritten_552_m06-106\line_7.jpg	light gravity became an increasing delight - the ugly
Crop_lines\184_handwritten_552_m06-106\line_8.jpg	flopping movements of flymen on the Heavy World
Crop_lines\184_handwritten_552_m06-106\line_9.jpg	had no place here.
Crop_lines\185_handwritten_593_p02-000\line_0.jpg	There were few passengers on the plane and Gavin was
Crop_lines\185_handwritten_593_p02-000\line_1.jpg	quickly through the customs. "Gay!” ”Gavin!” The girl
Crop_lines\185_handwritten_593_p02-000\line_2.jpg	and her luggage had disappeared and they were alone
Crop_lines\185_handwritten_593_p02-000\line_3.jpg	together. The porter brought Gavin’s bag out to the
Crop_lines\185_handwritten_593_p02-000\line_4.jpg	taxi. ”Just a moment, darling,” Gavin pressed her
Crop_lines\185_handwritten_593_p02-000\line_5.jpg	hand and smiled. ”I want to check up on the
Crop_lines\185_handwritten_593_p02-000\line_6.jpg	flights back.”
Crop_lines\186_handwritten_603_p02-115\line_0.jpg	Doc gave her hand a shake., Wake up
Crop_lines\186_handwritten_603_p02-115\line_1.jpg	Gay, and don’t even contemplate throwing
Crop_lines\186_handwritten_603_p02-115\line_2.jpg	yourself away on a chap like that. You’re a
Crop_lines\186_handwritten_603_p02-115\line_3.jpg	fine girl, intelligent, and pretty, and I had
Crop_lines\186_handwritten_603_p02-115\line_4.jpg	thought you were sensible too. Don’t
Crop_lines\186_handwritten_603_p02-115\line_5.jpg	make a fool of yourself over someone
Crop_lines\186_handwritten_603_p02-115\line_6.jpg	who doesn’t care two jots for your feelings.
Crop_lines\186_handwritten_603_p02-115\line_7.jpg	If he behaves like this now what is your
Crop_lines\186_handwritten_603_p02-115\line_8.jpg	married life going to be like ?
Crop_lines\187_handwritten_606_p02-131\line_0.jpg	Now let him go and you won’t have to wait
Crop_lines\187_handwritten_606_p02-131\line_1.jpg	long for the right man for you to come
Crop_lines\187_handwritten_606_p02-131\line_2.jpg	along. If I was thirty years younger and weren’t
Crop_lines\187_handwritten_606_p02-131\line_3.jpg	married to the sweetest wife in the world
Crop_lines\187_handwritten_606_p02-131\line_4.jpg	I’d marry you myself.” Gay laughed, Doc was
Crop_lines\187_handwritten_606_p02-131\line_5.jpg	so kind and nice and she hoped that one
Crop_lines\187_handwritten_606_p02-131\line_6.jpg	day she would be able to see the situation
Crop_lines\187_handwritten_606_p02-131\line_7.jpg	as it obviously appeared to everyone else.
Crop_lines\188_handwritten_610_p02-150\line_0.jpg	Because she was second best. The others came back To
Crop_lines\188_handwritten_610_p02-150\line_1.jpg	The table, all of them making a fuss of her and at once she
Crop_lines\188_handwritten_610_p02-150\line_2.jpg	Felt happier. Gay loved them for their warm sympathy,
Crop_lines\188_handwritten_610_p02-150\line_3.jpg	knowing that they were real friends, even if they were new ones.
Crop_lines\188_handwritten_610_p02-150\line_4.jpg	”That is a pretty dress,” Lilyan commented, obviously sensing
Crop_lines\188_handwritten_610_p02-150\line_5.jpg	Gay’s distress and in a way that Doc, as a man, could not
Crop_lines\188_handwritten_610_p02-150\line_6.jpg	understand, knowing that Gay was as much ashamed
Crop_lines\188_handwritten_610_p02-150\line_7.jpg	For Gavin at the way he was Behaving as she
Crop_lines\188_handwritten_610_p02-150\line_8.jpg	was hurt for herself.
Crop_lines\189_handwritten_624_p03-121\line_0.jpg	I’m going with a shooting party. What else can I do
Crop_lines\189_handwritten_624_p03-121\line_1.jpg	at this time of year: I can’t ask you up because it’s
Crop_lines\189_handwritten_624_p03-121\line_2.jpg	a strictly stag affair.” ”I know. I didn’t expect ...”Well,
Crop_lines\189_handwritten_624_p03-121\line_3.jpg	don’t keep hinting, then. You wish you could
Crop_lines\189_handwritten_624_p03-121\line_4.jpg	come with me; you hope I’ll miss you; you
Crop_lines\189_handwritten_624_p03-121\line_5.jpg	can’t imagine the hospital without me for
Crop_lines\189_handwritten_624_p03-121\line_6.jpg	three weeks, etcetera, etcetera!!”
Crop_lines\190_handwritten_626_p03-142\line_0.jpg	”Darling!” her voiced caressed him.” Moments like this
Crop_lines\190_handwritten_626_p03-142\line_1.jpg	make all the waiting worth while. When we’re
Crop_lines\190_handwritten_626_p03-142\line_2.jpg	married we won’t have these explosions of emotion,
Crop_lines\190_handwritten_626_p03-142\line_3.jpg	will we?” ”No,” he eyed her strangely.” I wish we
Crop_lines\190_handwritten_626_p03-142\line_4.jpg	were married, Di. Like a patient wishes his operation
Crop_lines\190_handwritten_626_p03-142\line_5.jpg	was over.” Again her laughter trilled. ”Marriage
Crop_lines\190_handwritten_626_p03-142\line_6.jpg	isn’t as bad as an operation, Nigel!”
Crop_lines\191_handwritten_627_p03-151\line_0.jpg	"Isn’t it?” he rose and smoothed himself
Crop_lines\191_handwritten_627_p03-151\line_1.jpg	down.” Ask any bridegroom-to-be. Anyhow,
Crop_lines\191_handwritten_627_p03-151\line_2.jpg	that particular problem isn’t looming at
Crop_lines\191_handwritten_627_p03-151\line_3.jpg	the moment, thank God!” Problem ... ?
Crop_lines\191_handwritten_627_p03-151\line_4.jpg	looming ... ? ”Are we discussing a marriage
Crop_lines\191_handwritten_627_p03-151\line_5.jpg	or a burial?” she asked, hardly believing
Crop_lines\191_handwritten_627_p03-151\line_6.jpg	he could be serious. ”Surely marrying
Crop_lines\191_handwritten_627_p03-151\line_7.jpg	me isn’t going to be all that bad?
Crop_lines\192_handwritten_628_p03-158\line_0.jpg	If it is -” she laughed uncertainly - ”’you can have
Crop_lines\192_handwritten_628_p03-158\line_1.jpg	your ring back.” She loosened the half-hoop of
Crop_lines\192_handwritten_628_p03-158\line_2.jpg	diamonds on her left hand third finger and held it
Crop_lines\192_handwritten_628_p03-158\line_3.jpg	out to him, still playfully. Without a glimmer
Crop_lines\192_handwritten_628_p03-158\line_4.jpg	of amusement in his own eyes, however, he took
Crop_lines\192_handwritten_628_p03-158\line_5.jpg	it, looking moodily beyond her. ”Perhaps it’s as
Crop_lines\192_handwritten_628_p03-158\line_6.jpg	well if you don’t wear it for a bit, Di,” he
Crop_lines\192_handwritten_628_p03-158\line_7.jpg	told her.
Crop_lines\193_handwritten_632_p03-185\line_0.jpg	Thus had they parted the previous evening and now
Crop_lines\193_handwritten_632_p03-185\line_1.jpg	Diana was trailing up the gravelled drive to the hospital
Crop_lines\193_handwritten_632_p03-185\line_2.jpg	alone. Of course one couldn’t say for certain when a
Crop_lines\193_handwritten_632_p03-185\line_3.jpg	doctor would be free during the day; tea was served
Crop_lines\193_handwritten_632_p03-185\line_4.jpg	from four until five-thirty in the residents’ common-
Crop_lines\193_handwritten_632_p03-185\line_5.jpg	room, which proved the elasticity of medical commitments.
Crop_lines\193_handwritten_632_p03-185\line_6.jpg	Something had cropped up which required Nigel’s attention,
Crop_lines\193_handwritten_632_p03-185\line_7.jpg	she was convinced, or he would have granted her small request
Crop_lines\193_handwritten_632_p03-185\line_8.jpg	to be met at the gates.
Crop_lines\194_handwritten_636_r02-000\line_0.jpg	He had long sensed injustice in the distinctions
Crop_lines\194_handwritten_636_r02-000\line_1.jpg	drawn between ordinary wage-earners and those
Crop_lines\194_handwritten_636_r02-000\line_2.jpg	self-employed. By the time his monthly salary
Crop_lines\194_handwritten_636_r02-000\line_3.jpg	arrived, the Inland Revenue had already taken
Crop_lines\194_handwritten_636_r02-000\line_4.jpg	their share, and there were precious few
Crop_lines\194_handwritten_636_r02-000\line_5.jpg	reductions in tax save for wives, children,
Crop_lines\194_handwritten_636_r02-000\line_6.jpg	life-insurances or any of the other normal
Crop_lines\194_handwritten_636_r02-000\line_7.jpg	encumbrances which Cecil had so far avoided.
Crop_lines\195_handwritten_652_r02-127\line_0.jpg	Cecil wriggled irritably under the misplaced management
Crop_lines\195_handwritten_652_r02-127\line_1.jpg	of a mother who had failed to realise that a son
Crop_lines\195_handwritten_652_r02-127\line_2.jpg	who is nearly bald is no longer a baby. He started to
Crop_lines\195_handwritten_652_r02-127\line_3.jpg	climb the stairs, stamping with unnecessary vigour upon
Crop_lines\195_handwritten_652_r02-127\line_4.jpg	the treads. ’And don’t wipe the dirt off on the
Crop_lines\195_handwritten_652_r02-127\line_5.jpg	towel like you did yesterday.
Crop_lines\196_handwritten_660_r03-030\line_0.jpg	The next thing that Serena discovered was that
Crop_lines\196_handwritten_660_r03-030\line_1.jpg	she could not afford to buy a house at all.
Crop_lines\196_handwritten_660_r03-030\line_2.jpg	And this in spite of having at last managed
Crop_lines\196_handwritten_660_r03-030\line_3.jpg	to save the ten percent needed. Or so she
Crop_lines\196_handwritten_660_r03-030\line_4.jpg	thought, being then in possession of what
Crop_lines\196_handwritten_660_r03-030\line_5.jpg	seemed to her the princely sum of six hund-
Crop_lines\196_handwritten_660_r03-030\line_6.jpg	red pounds. The lawyer said:
Crop_lines\197_handwritten_663_r03-056\line_0.jpg	”Yes, well....” He judged that she had been sufficiently
Crop_lines\197_handwritten_663_r03-056\line_1.jpg	dazzled and gave a long raucous cough. ”Only
Crop_lines\197_handwritten_663_r03-056\line_2.jpg	cigarettes worth smoking, these. Most unhealthy, English
Crop_lines\197_handwritten_663_r03-056\line_3.jpg	ones. Well, now, let me see. I think I can put you onto
Crop_lines\197_handwritten_663_r03-056\line_4.jpg	some people who might, I say might, let you have a mortgage on
Crop_lines\197_handwritten_663_r03-056\line_5.jpg	this property....” ”But, they’re safe, are they? I mean,
Crop_lines\197_handwritten_663_r03-056\line_6.jpg	they’re not - money-lenders?” ”Mrs. - er - Buttery,
Crop_lines\197_handwritten_663_r03-056\line_7.jpg	all mortgage companies are money-lenders.
Crop_lines\198_handwritten_666_r03-090\line_0.jpg	Our lawyers -” ”Who are your lawyers?”
Crop_lines\198_handwritten_666_r03-090\line_1.jpg	”Clacton’s.” ” Well, I’m damned.” ”Now, let me see,
Crop_lines\198_handwritten_666_r03-090\line_2.jpg	you say your husband earns about ... yes,
Crop_lines\198_handwritten_666_r03-090\line_3.jpg	that would come to... three, carry seven, six
Crop_lines\198_handwritten_666_r03-090\line_4.jpg	nines are fifty four - of course we’d have to
Crop_lines\198_handwritten_666_r03-090\line_5.jpg	have some sort of proof, you know, it’s very
Crop_lines\198_handwritten_666_r03-090\line_6.jpg	difficult with self-employed persons, carry two.
Crop_lines\199_handwritten_667_r03-096\line_0.jpg	Yes. I’m afraid we couldn’t raise this loan to more
Crop_lines\199_handwritten_667_r03-096\line_1.jpg	than three thousand three fifty at the most. Now you
Crop_lines\199_handwritten_667_r03-096\line_2.jpg	could get quite a nice little semi-detached house in
Crop_lines\199_handwritten_667_r03-096\line_3.jpg	Grimstead for three thousand, that’s where I live, just
Crop_lines\199_handwritten_667_r03-096\line_4.jpg	before the green belt, lovely and modern, you know.
Crop_lines\199_handwritten_667_r03-096\line_5.jpg	I forgot to tell you, we don’t usually lend any
Crop_lines\199_handwritten_667_r03-096\line_6.jpg	house built earlier than 1918.”
