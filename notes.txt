#data.ipynb
- we need to perform some sort of preprocessing

#important variables
folder_names - contains the folders names (key)
data - use folder_names "key" to obtain the list of images of folder

# important function
- get_images_in_folder
example: (2 ways)
test_000_text = get_images_in_folder(data, '000')
test_000 = get_images_in_folder(data, folder_names[0])

example:
len(data[folder_names[0]]) ~ outputs the number of images in folder '000'

list_of_images_in_folder = get_images_in_folder(data[folder_names[0]])


todo:
- enhances the images for the best segmentation and classification results
- segment the paper,
- recognizer (extract text from and position)
- font conversion from user handwritten to desired font
- regenerate using the gather data (make searchable text) [import fitz]~pyMuPDF
